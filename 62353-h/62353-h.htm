<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SPEAKER, </span></p>
<p class="font2" style="text-align:center;">And to the Honourable the Knights, Citizens,&nbsp;and Burgesses, of this&nbsp;Present Parliament of<span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;Great-Britain,</span><span class="font2"> Assembled. </span></p>
<p class="font2">May it Please your Honours, </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE First Edition of this little Tract, Relating to&nbsp;Trade, the Poor,</span> <span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">was Humbly Dedicated&nbsp;to his Royal Highness the Prince&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wales, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">when Governor of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">South-Sea Company, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">which I then&nbsp;thought, as I still do, might be of&nbsp;Service to the Nation, by alluring the&nbsp;Heir to the Crown, into an Early&nbsp;Liking of Trade, and Setting before&nbsp;him the Advantages that Accrue&nbsp;from it, with the Methods whereby&nbsp;it may be Improved; and therefore I&nbsp;Contracted it into a Narrow Compass, to Encourage his Reading it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THIS Second Edition, whereto I have added some Sure and Practicable Methods, for Discharging the&nbsp;Publick Debts of the Nation, with&nbsp;most Ease to the People, I humbly&nbsp;Present to this Honourable House; If&nbsp;it may be Usefull in your Debates, I&nbsp;shall think my self very Happy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">’TIS the Ballance of our Trade, that Supplies us with Bullion; if&nbsp;That be in our Favour, it brings it to&nbsp;us, if Otherwise, it must be Carried&nbsp;away. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THIS Ballance is Supported by our Manufactures, which keep our&nbsp;People at Work, and Enable them to&nbsp;Maintain themselves by their own&nbsp;Labour, who must else Stand still, and&nbsp;become a Charge on our Lands; and&nbsp;therefore I humbly Conceive it to be&nbsp;our Interest,</span><span class="font2"> First, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to Encourage their&nbsp;being worn at Home, and then to&nbsp;give a Preference to such things, as&nbsp;are Purchased for them Abroad, Rather than to those, which are Bought&nbsp;for Bullion; And if our Trade was&nbsp;well Regulated, we should soon become&nbsp;the Richest, and consequently the&nbsp;Greatest, People in</span><span class="font2"> Europe. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I have made some Essay at such Methods, as I doubt not, being Improved by your Wisdoms, and Strengthened by your Authority, may Tend very&nbsp;much to the Effecting this great Work;&nbsp;And I humbly Offer the Six Propositions following, as so many Fundamentals, Necessary, for the better Ordering of our Trade, the Discharging of&nbsp;our Publick Debts, and Supporting the&nbsp;Credit of the Kingdom, whereby His&nbsp;Majesty will be Rendred more Glorious, both at Home and Abroad. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE First is, a Committee of Trade, Made up of such Men as are&nbsp;well Verst in the true Principles&nbsp;whereon it is Founded, and thereby&nbsp;Enabled to make right Representations&nbsp;of such things, as shall be Referred to&nbsp;them by the Parliament; who, Holding their Places, according as they are&nbsp;thought Capable of Performing them,&nbsp;will be Carefull to Execute those Trusts&nbsp;with Judgment, Honour and Honesty. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE Second is, a Due Inspection into the Affairs of the Poor, and&nbsp;putting an End to that Pernicious&nbsp;Trade of Begging, which I can Assure&nbsp;this Honourable House, from the Experience we have had in their Regulation at</span><span class="font2"> Bristol, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">may be done, and that&nbsp;the Poor may be Trained up to an Early&nbsp;Delight in Labour; The Means and&nbsp;Methods whereby That was&nbsp;Accomplished, though at first thought&nbsp;Impracticable, I have set forth in the&nbsp;Appendix.</span><span class="font2"> pag. 143. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE Third is, the Keeping of our own Wooll at Home, and Preventing the Wooll of</span><span class="font2"> Ireland </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">from being&nbsp;Transported any where else, save to&nbsp;this Kingdom only; which I am Persuaded can never be done, by any other&nbsp;Method, but by a Register, and that&nbsp;That will effectually do it; towards&nbsp;which I have made an Essay in the&nbsp;following Treatise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE Fourth is, the Encouraging the Linnen-Manufacture in</span><span class="font2"> Ireland;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">’Tis not Easy to Comprehend the Advantages that will thence arise to both&nbsp;Kingdoms, when Each of them shall&nbsp;be fully Employed, on a Distinct Manufacture; The Hands that are now&nbsp;kept at Work there, on the Spinning&nbsp;of Wooll, might be then Turned to Linnen, and a great Part of their Lands&nbsp;would be taken up, in Raising Flax and&nbsp;Hemp, for which they are very Proper; and then a Stop might be put to&nbsp;the Importation of those Great Quantities of Worsted and Woollen Yarn&nbsp;thence, so Pernicious to the Poor of this&nbsp;Kingdom, the Spinning whereof, if&nbsp;Imported in Wooll, would amount to&nbsp;many Thousand Pounds</span><span class="font2"> per Annum, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to be Divided amongst them; And it is Certain, that Spinning is the most Profitable Part of the Woollen-Manufacture, because it is done by Women and&nbsp;Children, who can no otherwise be&nbsp;Employed. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">IN the Year</span><span class="font0"> 1704</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">, I was Desired by the Ministry, to give my Thoughts&nbsp;of such an Undertaking, which I then&nbsp;did, and Printed some Considerations&nbsp;Relating thereto, Adapted for that&nbsp;time, which I have added in the&nbsp;Appendix,</span><span class="font0"> pag. 187. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NOR can This be any Prejudice to the Linnens of</span><span class="font0"> North-Britain, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">being&nbsp;of quite different Sorts; which should&nbsp;also for many Reasons be Encouraged,&nbsp;by such Means and Methods, as on due&nbsp;Consideration may be thought proper. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">THE Fifth is, the Carrying on the Fishery, which Deserves all the Encouragement the Legislature can give&nbsp;it; and I think the Readiest way to do&nbsp;it, is, by Incorporating such Societies,&nbsp;as are willing to set upon it with Joint&nbsp;Stocks, but not Exclusive to any others,&nbsp;which will Promote Industry, and Shut&nbsp;out Stock-Jobbing, the Bane of so&nbsp;many Good Undertakings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">THE Sixth, and indeed the Foundation of all the Rest, is, the Establishing a Substantial Credit, Large enough&nbsp;to Answer all the Occasions of the Nation, both Publick and Private, which is&nbsp;the Wheel whereon all the Rest must&nbsp;Turn, and whereby, not only the Trade&nbsp;of the Kingdom, but also the Occasions&nbsp;of the Government, may be Supplied,&nbsp;and the Publick Debts gradually Sunk,&nbsp;by a Good Management; and This, I&nbsp;Humbly Conceive, cannot be Setled any&nbsp;other way, but on a Parliamentary&nbsp;Foundation, any thing less, will be&nbsp;too Narrow. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">IN the Year</span><span class="font2"> 1696</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">, I made some Essay towards such a Credit, which I&nbsp;then Presented to both Houses of Parliament, and have now Incerted it in&nbsp;the Appendix,</span><span class="font2"> Pag. 165. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">But the Bank&nbsp;of</span><span class="font2"> England, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">having about that time&nbsp;Furnished his Majesty with a Considerable&nbsp;Sum of Money, then very much&nbsp;wanted, for the present Payment of the&nbsp;Army, which the Ministry could not&nbsp;otherwise have Raised, though they Approved of the Projection, were Unwilling to Disoblige at that Juncture, by&nbsp;Setting up any thing like theirs, and so&nbsp;that Matter Slept then, as it had&nbsp;ever done, if I had not Observed, that&nbsp;the Famous Mr.</span><span class="font2"> Laws </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">had drawn a&nbsp;Scheme from it, for the Service of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">France, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as near as the Constitution of&nbsp;that Kingdom will admit; Not that I&nbsp;think it can be Lasting, the Foundation&nbsp;being laid on Sand; Yet it hath Served&nbsp;the Present Occasion, to Pay off the&nbsp;Debts of that Nation, by an Incredible&nbsp;Stock-Job, which must in all Probability,&nbsp;End in Confusion and Discontent. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">NOTHING can Support a National Credit, but a Steady Government, where the Arbitrary Will of a Prince,&nbsp;cannot withdraw, or Lessen the Security&nbsp;at his Pleasure; and had such&nbsp;a One been then Established here, in all&nbsp;Probability, we bad been severall Millions less in Debt, and not felt that&nbsp;Heavy Load of Taxes, which hath Opprest&nbsp;our Lands, and Injured our Trade;&nbsp;Nor do I think those Debts can be&nbsp;Discharged by any other way, Private&nbsp;Men now carrying off those Profits,&nbsp;which should Sink them by Degrees. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE Advantages of a National Bank, and the Good Effects it will&nbsp;have, in this Free Government, towards the Lessening our National Incumbrances, will plainly Appear, when&nbsp;it is Considered, that One Hundred&nbsp;Pounds Borrowed, will Circulate Two,&nbsp;besides it self, and thereby Reduce the&nbsp;Interest, to One Third Part of what is&nbsp;paid to the Lender, but if it Circulates&nbsp;Three, then to a Quarter, and it may&nbsp;be, to much Less, according as a Bank&nbsp;hath Credit, and is found Usefull. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">BY this Rule, if the Publick Pays Four</span><span class="font2"> per Cent. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">for Interest, it may by&nbsp;Circulation be Reduced to One, and&nbsp;there is no Doubt, but that a Well-Constituted&nbsp;Bank, will be soon Fill’d</span> <span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">with&nbsp;Money at that Rate; the great Ground&nbsp;of Buying and Selling Stocks being, the&nbsp;Vast Sums of Money which lye Dead&nbsp;on Mens Hands, who hope thereby to&nbsp;make some Profit, but would be Glad&nbsp;to Dispose of it, on a Substantial Security, at a Moderate Interest; Besides&nbsp;the Advantage it will be to Widdows&nbsp;and Orphans, whose Money would be&nbsp;Safely Lodged, and bring them in a&nbsp;Certain Income, for their Maintenance; And here will be no Room left&nbsp;for Stock-Jobbing, which hath now gotten&nbsp;such a Footing, even into our Publick&nbsp;Affairs, that the Parliament doth not&nbsp;give a Land-Tax or a Lottery, where&nbsp;the Subscriptions to it are not Ingrost,&nbsp;by those who have not Money, in Order to make an Advantage, by Selling&nbsp;them to such as have, besides the Vast&nbsp;Charge in the Management of Lotteries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">AND as to Trade, the Bank of </span><span class="font2">England </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hath been very Serviceable&nbsp;to this Great Metropolis, by making a&nbsp;Little Money serve the Uses of a Great&nbsp;Deal, but the Benefit thereof hath Extended no farther; And why other&nbsp;Cities, and indeed the whole Kingdom, should not have the same Advantage, (which it will, if a&nbsp;National Bank be Established, and Chambers Setled where Desired,) I cannot&nbsp;Conceive. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">AND here I must Refer to the Appendix, for the better Illustrating&nbsp;the Benefit thereof, and the Manner of&nbsp;its Institution, as then Intended, which&nbsp;must now admit of several Alterations. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">IF such a Bank were Setled, the Charge of Managing it would be very&nbsp;little, and the Kingdom might grow&nbsp;Richer some Millions every Year, and&nbsp;the Government have an Addition to&nbsp;its Security, by drawing the Cash of&nbsp;other Nations hither, whose Interest&nbsp;would thereby become Interwoven with&nbsp;Ours; and Our Manufactures would&nbsp;be Encouraged, by a Flux of Money,&nbsp;which is the Life of Trade; and This,&nbsp;with the Easiness of our Government,&nbsp;would bring the Monied Men of </span><span class="font2">Europe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to Settle here, which would be an&nbsp;Addition to our Wealth; The Trader&nbsp;might hence be Supplied, with such&nbsp;Sums of Money, as he shall want, and&nbsp;for so long time only, as he shall have&nbsp;Occasion to use it; whereby the Fishery,&nbsp;and other Good Undertakings, may&nbsp;be Encouraged, and our Wooll be certainly kept at Home; and the Gentlemen of</span><span class="font2"> England </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">may be hence&nbsp;Furnished with Money at the Common Interest, and be Permitted, to make their&nbsp;Payments by such Parts, as they can&nbsp;best spare it</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">; the Want of which is&nbsp;now such a Clog upon their Estates, that&nbsp;it destroys many Good Families; who,&nbsp;when they are once gotten into the Usurers&nbsp;Books, can find no way to get out,&nbsp;till they have Paid the whole Debt at&nbsp;once, so that their Estates are devoured, by Procuration and Continuation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">NOR is it hereby Intended to put a Force upon any Man; ’twill be the&nbsp;Interest of the Lender to put his Money into this Bank, where he hath so&nbsp;certain a Security, and of the Bank&nbsp;to take it in; and on the other Side, it&nbsp;will be the Interest of the Bank to&nbsp;Furnish Money on the Terms here Mentioned, and of the Borrower to Receive&nbsp;it; and this Single thing, will in time&nbsp;bring so great a Profit to the Publick,&nbsp;as will very much Sink the Debts of&nbsp;the Nation, whilst a Common Advantage is Interwoven with it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">NEITHER will this break in on the Priviledges Granted to the Bank&nbsp;of</span><span class="font2"> England, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">by Act of Parliament;&nbsp;for though they are allowed to Lend&nbsp;Money to the Government, on the&nbsp;Terms therein Mentioned, yet the&nbsp;Government hath not bound up it self,&nbsp;from Borrowing of any Others, and making their Payments in such a&nbsp;Manner, as shall be thought most&nbsp;Advantagious to the Nation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">IF any Objections (not grounded on Private Interest) shall be made to&nbsp;what I have here Offered, I believe a&nbsp;Satisfactory Answer may be given to&nbsp;them, if this Honourable House shall&nbsp;think what I have Written, Worth&nbsp;their Consideration. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ALL I shall further add is, that it can scarce be Matter of Doubt, but&nbsp;that most Men will Part with their&nbsp;Securities on Private Funds, and Rely&nbsp;on the General Credit of the Nation,&nbsp;though at a Lower Interest, whereby&nbsp;those Funds will by Degrees, become&nbsp;a part of the General Security, which,&nbsp;with what New Taxes shall be given,&nbsp;will be so Helpfull in Circulation, that&nbsp;it will be next to Impossible, for the&nbsp;most Malicious Projectors, to Lessen the Credit of such a Bank, or to make a Run upon it; and those Taxes that&nbsp;are Heaviest on the Poor, and most Injurious to our Manufactures, may be&nbsp;taken off: And there will be this&nbsp;farther Advantage, that the several&nbsp;Offices, who are Entrusted to Buy for&nbsp;the Use of the Publick, according to&nbsp;such Sums of Money, as shall from&nbsp;time to time be Appropriated by the&nbsp;Parliament, will be Enabled to Purchase all things on the Lowest Terms,&nbsp;when their Bills on this Bank, shall be&nbsp;as Punctually Discharged, at the time&nbsp;when they become Due, as if they were&nbsp;Bills of Exchange, and in the mean&nbsp;time pass from Man to Man in Payment, which will be an Addition to&nbsp;the Cash of the Nation, whereby a&nbsp;great deal will be Saved in what they&nbsp;Lay out; and Men of Industry, but of&nbsp;Small Stocks, will be Enabled to deal with the Government, which now they cannot do; and will Endeavour&nbsp;who shall Supply it on the Best Terms,&nbsp;when by such Payments, they shall&nbsp;be Furnished, to go to Market again;&nbsp;And the Debts of the Nation will be&nbsp;so Incorporated therewith, that it&nbsp;will be every Man’s Interest to&nbsp;Support its Credit; and the Eye of a Parliament, which hath Power to make&nbsp;Examples of Offenders, who through&nbsp;Fraud or Malice, shall Offer Violence&nbsp;thereto, will be sufficient to Deter, from such Evil Practices. </span></p>
<p class="font2" style="text-align:left;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 100pt;">I am, </p>

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Of Trade in General.</span>IN Order to discover, whether a Nation gets or loses by its&nbsp;Trade, ’tis necessary first to enquire into the Principles whereon it is built; for Trade hath its Principles, as other Sciences have, and as&nbsp;difficult to be understood: But when they are,&nbsp;’tis easy to discover whether a Nation gets or&nbsp;loses by its Management, and without this,&nbsp;we are not capable of making any true Judgment, it being possible for the Publick to grow&nbsp;Poor, whilst private Persons encrease their&nbsp;Fortunes. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Design of this little Treatise is to dissect and lay open the Trade of this Kingdom, as it is now driven, that so those Branches that shall appear to be Profitable may be&nbsp;Encourag’d, and those that are Otherwise may&nbsp;be Amended. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Profits of this Kingdom arise from its Product and Manufactures at Home, and&nbsp;from the Growths of those several Plantations&nbsp;it hath settled Abroad, and from the Fish&nbsp;taken on the Coasts, all which being raised&nbsp;by the Industry of the People, are both its&nbsp;true Riches, and the Tools whereby it Trades&nbsp;to other Nations, the Products coming from&nbsp;the Earth, and the Manufacturing of them&nbsp;being an Addition to their Value by the Labour of the People; now where we Barter&nbsp;these things abroad for such as are only fit&nbsp;to be Eat and Drank, or are wasted among&nbsp;ourselves, tho’ one Man may get by the Luxury of another, yet the Wealth of the Kingdom doth not encrease: But it is otherwise&nbsp;where we change them for Bullion, or for&nbsp;Commodities fit to be manufactur’d again. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Its Original.</span>The first Original of Trade both Domestic and Foreign was Barter, when one private Person, having an Overplus of such&nbsp;Things as his Neighbour wanted, furnish’d&nbsp;him therewith for their Value in such whereof&nbsp;the Other had Plenty, but he stood in need&nbsp;of; the same, when one Nation abounding&nbsp;in those Products which another wanted, supply’d&nbsp;it therewith, and received for them&nbsp;Things equally necessary in their stead: And&nbsp;by how much the Products of any Nation&nbsp;exceeded its Wants, by so much it grew richer,&nbsp;the Remainder being sold for Bullion, or&nbsp;some Staple Commodity, allow’d by all to&nbsp;have an intrinsick Value. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And as People encreased, so did Commerce, which caused many to go off from Husbandry to Manufactures and other Ways&nbsp;of Living, for Convenience whereof they&nbsp;began Communities; This was the Original&nbsp;of Towns, which being found necessary for&nbsp;Trade, their Inhabitants encreased by Expectation of Profit; This introduced Foreign&nbsp;Trade, or Traffick with neighbouring Nations;&nbsp;and this a Desire to settle rather on some Navigable Rivers, than in remote Inland Places,&nbsp;whereby they might be more easily supply’d&nbsp;from the Country with Commodities fit to&nbsp;export, and disperse thither those they had&nbsp;imported from abroad. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">The Trade of this Kingdom.</span>I shall now take the Trade of this Kingdom, as it is divided into Domestick and Foreign, and consider each, and how they are advantagious to the Nation, and may be made&nbsp;more so. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Inland Trade.</span>The Domestick or Inland Trade consists either in Husbandry, Manufactures, or Buying and Selling; <span class="sni">Buying &amp; Selling.</span>the last of which, whereby one&nbsp;Man lives by the Profit he makes by another,&nbsp;brings no Advantage to the Publick; Peoples&nbsp;Occasions requiring Commodities to be retail’d&nbsp;to them in such small Quantities as would fit&nbsp;their Necessities, they were willing to allow a&nbsp;Profit to him who bought them in greater;&nbsp;and as this sort of Traffick came more in use,&nbsp;so the first Buyers, not only sold their Commodities to the Consumers in the Places where&nbsp;they dwelt, but also to others, who being&nbsp;seated in the Country at a Distance, made an&nbsp;Advantage by supplying the Inhabitants there:&nbsp;This begat the Ingrossing Commodities, and&nbsp;thence arose Skill and Cunning to foresee their&nbsp;Rise and Falls, according to their Consumption&nbsp;and Prospect of Supply. Hence came&nbsp;the Viciating our Manufactures, every one&nbsp;endeavouring to underbuy, that he might&nbsp;undersell his Neighbour; Which way of&nbsp;Living being found in time to have less Labour and more Profit than Husbandry and&nbsp;Manufactures, was the Reason so many fell&nbsp;into it. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">From these Bargains Differencies arising, encouraged another Sort of People, whose&nbsp;Business it was, either by their Wisdoms to&nbsp;persuade, or by their Knowledge in the Laws&nbsp;to compel, the unjust Persons to do Right to&nbsp;their Fellow-Traders (an Honourable Employment at the first, and is still so in those who&nbsp;keep to the strict Rules of its Institution).&nbsp;Hence arose Attorneys, Sollicitors, and other&nbsp;Officers, which were found necessary to attend on those Suits, and other Services of the&nbsp;Law. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Trade brought Riches, and Riches Luxury; Luxury brought Sickness, and Sickness wanted Physick; which required some to separate&nbsp;themselves to study the Nature of Plants&nbsp;and Simples, as also of those several Diseases&nbsp;which bring Men to their Ends, who for their&nbsp;Advice received Gratuities from their Patients:&nbsp;These brought in Apothecaries and Surgeons,&nbsp;as necessary Attendants to their Employments;&nbsp;all which were maintained by keeping People&nbsp;in their Healths. Many also of ripe Parts&nbsp;were fitted for the Service of the Church,&nbsp;others of the State; great Numbers were employ’d in providing Necessaries of Meat,&nbsp;Drink, and Apparel, others in fitting things&nbsp;for Delights and Pleasures, and by this means,&nbsp;leaving Husbandry and Manufactures, flockt&nbsp;off daily to Livelihoods, which tho’ useful&nbsp;and convenient in their respective Stations,&nbsp;yet cannot be said to encrease the Riches of this&nbsp;Nation, but to live by getting from one another; Husbandry and Manufactures being the&nbsp;profitable Employments, out of which it gathers its Wealth. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Husbandry.</span>The next Part of the Inland Trade of this Kingdom is Husbandry, which anteceded&nbsp;Buying and Selling in point of time, tho'&nbsp;the other is treated of first in this Discourse;&nbsp;and this consists either in Feeding or Tillage,&nbsp;by both which we raise great Store of Cattle,&nbsp;Corn and Fruits, fit for the Food, Service,&nbsp;and Trade of the Inhabitants. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Feeding.</span>To begin with Feeding: And here I might enumerate the various sorts of Cattle raised and&nbsp;bred by the Care of the Husbandman, but&nbsp;those of most Note with respect to our Trade&nbsp;are, </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1. The Beef; which besides the Excellency of its Flesh for Food, affords many&nbsp;Necessaries for our Trade, and is very serviceable in Tillage; with this we both nourish&nbsp;our Inhabitants at home, victual our Ships for&nbsp;foreign Voyages, and load them with the&nbsp;several Manufactures wherewith it doth supply&nbsp;us; from the Milk we make Butter and&nbsp;Cheese, from the Flesh Beef, from the Skin&nbsp;Leather, from the Fat Tallow, and of the&nbsp;Horns several useful Necessaries; the Overplus whereof above our own&nbsp;Consumption we export, and sell in foreign Markets. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2. The Sheep; whose Golden Fleece being the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Primum</span><span class="font6"> of our Woollen-Manufactures, does thereby employ Multitudes of our People; which being of different Lengths and&nbsp;Fineness, makes them of various sorts;&nbsp;whereof they afford us a yearly Crop whilst&nbsp;living, and at their Deaths we have their&nbsp;Flesh and Skins; the first serves for our&nbsp;Food, and of the last we make Things, fit&nbsp;to be used at Home, and Traded with&nbsp;Abroad. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">3. Horses; whose Labour is so necessary, that we can neither carry on our Husbandry&nbsp;or Trade without them; besides their Fitness for War, being accounted the boldest&nbsp;in the World; and for all these Uses are&nbsp;transported Abroad; for the first, to our Plantations in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6">, and for the last, to some&nbsp;of our Neighbouring Nations: But their&nbsp;Flesh is of no Use, their Skins of little, the&nbsp;Leather made of them being very ordinary,&nbsp;only the longest of their Hair is used in&nbsp;Weaving. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">There are sundry other sorts of Beasts, some whereof require no Care in Raising, others&nbsp;little, such as the Stag, the Deer, the&nbsp;Rabbet, the Hare, the Badger, the Goat,&nbsp;and many others, whose Skins are necessary&nbsp;for our Trade, and useful in our Manufactures. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Tillage.</span>Tillage is that whereby we raise our Corn by turning up the Earth; the several&nbsp;sorts whereof are Wheat, Rye, Barley, Pease,&nbsp;Beans, Vetches, Oats, &amp;c. which not only&nbsp;afford Nourishment to ourselves, and the&nbsp;Beasts we use in Labour, but serve also for&nbsp;Trade; as they give Employment to our&nbsp;People at home, and are transported Abroad,&nbsp;more or less, according to the Overplus of&nbsp;our Expence, and the Want of our Neighbours, besides the great Quantities us’d in our&nbsp;Navigation. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These Products are all clear Profit to the Nation, being raised from Earth and Labour; but their chief Advantages arise from&nbsp;their being Exported, either in their own&nbsp;kinds, or when wrought up, the Remainder,&nbsp;which is spent at Home, tending rather to&nbsp;supply our Wants, than to advance our&nbsp;Wealth: Which Exports being more or less&nbsp;according to the Price they bear in other&nbsp;Countries, and those arising from the Proportion their Lands hold with ours in their&nbsp;yearly Rents, are not so great in Specie, as&nbsp;when wrought up. Butter is the chiefest,&nbsp;wherewith we supply several Foreign Markets, and did formerly more, till by making&nbsp;it bad, and using Tricks to encrease its&nbsp;Weight, we lost much of that Trade, and&nbsp;are now almost beaten out of it by <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">which every year makes theirs better;&nbsp;besides, they undersell us in the Price, as they&nbsp;do also in Beef, occasioned by the low Rents&nbsp;of their Lands. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">’Twas the Act of Prohibition made formerly in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England,</span><span class="font6"> that first usher’d them into a Foreign Trade, their sole Dependance&nbsp;before that time being on our Markets, and&nbsp;from hence they were supplied with what they&nbsp;wanted; but being thereby prohibited from bringing hither their Cattle and other&nbsp;Provisions, they endeavoured to find a Vent for&nbsp;them in other Markets, which they did with&nbsp;good Success, and to more Advantage; the&nbsp;sweetness whereof gave a spring to their&nbsp;Industry, and put them on the&nbsp;Woollen-Manufactures, which they also vended where&nbsp;they exported their Provisions, till in time it&nbsp;became so great and flourishing, as to give us&nbsp;Apprehensions it would endanger ours. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Corn.</span>As for Corn; Foreign Markets are supplied therewith, both from thence, and from the&nbsp;Islands of the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Azores</span><span class="font6">, cheaper than the Rents&nbsp;of our Lands will admit; but our Plantations&nbsp;have still some Dependance on us for our Product, and as the Lands of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> rise in their&nbsp;yearly Value, they will have more. We&nbsp;also raise considerable Quantities of Hemp and&nbsp;Flax, both which are useful in our Trade. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Fruits.</span>The other Fruits of the Earth, such as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Plumbs, together&nbsp;with the Herbs and Plants, serve rather for&nbsp;Food and Delight than for Trade: some&nbsp;Cider we do export; also Spirits raised by the&nbsp;Distillers, both from some of these, and from&nbsp;Barly. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Fish.</span>On the Sea-Coast both of this Kingdom, and also of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Newfoundland</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New-England</span><span class="font6">, are caught great Store of Cod-Fish, Herrings,&nbsp;and Pilchards, which are saved, and sold in&nbsp;Foreign Markets. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Minerals.</span>Nor is this all the Product of our Earth, whose Womb being big with Treasure, brings&nbsp;forth Lead, Tin, Copper, Calamy, Coal,&nbsp;Culm, Iron, Allom, Coppetas, and sundry&nbsp;other Minerals, which are sold in Foreign&nbsp;Markets, whither we send them: Besides a&nbsp;great Expectation we have from a much richer&nbsp;and more valuable Discovery, lately made in&nbsp;that Part of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Great-Britain</span><span class="font6"> called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Trees.</span>Among the several Trees that adorn our Fields, the Oak, the Elm, and the Ash, are&nbsp;the chiefest; these not only serve in Building&nbsp;our Ships and Houses, but also furnish us&nbsp;with Materials, wherewith our Artificers make&nbsp;many Things fit for Commerce: And it were&nbsp;much to be wish’d, that better Care was taken&nbsp;to preserve our Timber, for the Benefit of&nbsp;Posterity. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Manufactures.</span>The third Part of our Inland Trade is our Manufactures, whereby our Products are<sup>&nbsp;</sup>improv’d in their Values, and made useful in&nbsp;sundry manners, both for our selves and&nbsp;others, by the Labour of our People; and fitted&nbsp;for such Services, as of their own Natures,&nbsp;without the help of Art, they could not have&nbsp;been proper; and those to suit the Necessities&nbsp;and Fancies, both of our own, and also of&nbsp;Foreign Countries to which we Export them;&nbsp;where they yield a Price, not only according to the true Value of the Materials and&nbsp;Labour, but an Overplus according to the&nbsp;Necessity and Humour of the Buyers: And this&nbsp;adds to the Profit, and encreases the Wealth&nbsp;of the Kingdom. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These Manufactures, as they employ Multitudes of our People in their Making,&nbsp;so also in Exporting them, and Importing Foreign Materials to be used with our own, such&nbsp;as Oyl, Dye-stuff, Silk, Wooll, Cotton, Barillia&nbsp;and many others, which are either Manufactured here by themselves, or workt up with&nbsp;our own Product. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Sheep’s-Wooll.</span>And first to begin with Sheep’s-Wooll, whereof either by it self, or mixt with Silk&nbsp;or Linnen, we make Varieties of pretty Things,&nbsp;fit for all Climates, and proper for the Wearing of both Sexes; wherein the Invention and&nbsp;Imitation of our Workmen have been so great,&nbsp;that they have out-done all that went before&nbsp;them. From a strong Cloth, fit to keep out&nbsp;Cold in Winter, they have turn’d their hands&nbsp;to a fine thin sort, which will scarce keep&nbsp;warm in Summer; from hence they fell on&nbsp;Perpets, Serges, Crapes, Stuffs, Sayes, Ratoons, Antherines, and many other Things,&nbsp;fit both for outward Garments, and inward&nbsp;Linings; of various Colours, Stripes, and&nbsp;Flowers, some of them so fine and pleasant,&nbsp;as scarce to be known from Silk: Besides&nbsp;those Multitudes of coarser Cloths for the Poor;&nbsp;also Rugs, Blankets, and all sorts of Furniture for Houses. And such a Progress have&nbsp;they made in these Manufactures, that a Man&nbsp;may have his Picture wrought at the Loom,&nbsp;with the same Exactness as if drawn with a&nbsp;Pencil; one Work-man vying to excell another, they make Things to answer all&nbsp;Occasions. And as for Arras and Tapestry, I&nbsp;believe it will be allowed, that they do not&nbsp;fall short of those from whom they first had&nbsp;the Art: Add to these, Hats, Stockings, and&nbsp;many other things, which are both worn at&nbsp;home, and Exported abroad. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Cotton-Wooll.</span>The next material for the Manufactures is Cotton Wooll, which is now become a great&nbsp;Imployment for the Poor, and so adds to the&nbsp;Wealth of the Kingdom; This being curiously&nbsp;pickt and spun, makes Dimities, Tapes,&nbsp;Stockings, Gloves, besides several things&nbsp;Wove fit for use, as Wastcoats, Pettycoats,&nbsp;and Drawers, of different Stripes and Finesses; and I doubt not the Workmen would&nbsp;equal the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East Indies</span><span class="font6"> for Callicoes, had they&nbsp;Encouragement; with all which we supply&nbsp;our Plantations and other Foreign Markets,&nbsp;besides what serves for our Consumption at&nbsp;Home. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Hemp and Flax.</span>Hemp and Flax are the Grounds for another Manufacture; for tho’ Weaving of Linnen is not so much used in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">South Britain</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">as of Woollen, yet in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">North Britain</span><span class="font6"> it is, and&nbsp;may be farther improved, not so much by&nbsp;Laws to direct the Workmen in their making&nbsp;it, as by apt Methods to Encourage them;&nbsp;and even in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">South Britain</span><span class="font6"> several Counties&nbsp;are imployed thereon, who not only supply&nbsp;themselves, but furnish those bordering on&nbsp;them, with such Cloth as answers the ends of&nbsp;</span>French<span class="font6"> Linnens: Besides which, great Quantities of Ticking, of all Finesses, Incle, Tapes,&nbsp;Sacking, Girtwhip, and many other things&nbsp;are made thereof; also Cordage, Twine, Netts,&nbsp;with Multitudes of other Manufactures, which&nbsp;Imploy the Poor, and bring by their Exports&nbsp;Profit to the Nation; and I can not here&nbsp;omit Sail-cloth, wherein we have made a wonderful Progress in a little time, at the Charge&nbsp;and Expence of private Stocks, who deserve&nbsp;to be Encouraged. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Glass.</span>Glass is a Manufacture brought to so great a Perfection, that it keeps many of our&nbsp;People at Work; and the Materials whereof&nbsp;it is made being generally our own, and in&nbsp;themselves of small Value, costs the Nation&nbsp;little, in comparison of what it formerly did,&nbsp;when we fetcht it from <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Venice; </span><span class="font6">the Noble&nbsp;Plate Glasses which we now make of all sorts,&nbsp;both for Houses and Coaches, do greatly set&nbsp;forth the Genius of our Workmen; besides&nbsp;the various sorts of Utensils made for common use, fit for all the Occasions of a Family, which look almost as well as Silver,&nbsp;and it would be better for the Nation that&nbsp;they were more used in its stead; also the&nbsp;Glass for Windows, of different Beauties;&nbsp;and Glass Bottles; all which find a greater&nbsp;Vent both at Home and Abroad by their&nbsp;Cheapness. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Earthen-Ware.</span>And as for Earthen Ware, the Progress we have made therein is such, as may give&nbsp;us Hopes, that Time will bring it to such a&nbsp;Perfection, as to equal if not exceed the&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Silk.</span>Silk is another Material for a great Manufacture; which being brought from Abroad&nbsp;Raw, we here Twist, Dye, and Weave into&nbsp;different Goodnesses, both Plain, Striped, and&nbsp;Flowered, either by it self, or mixt with Gold&nbsp;and Silver; so Richly Brocaded, that we exceed those from whom we first had the Art;&nbsp;Besides great Quantities of Ribbons, Silk&nbsp;Stockings, and other things, not only to serve&nbsp;our selves, but also to Export. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Distilling.</span>Distilling is an Art so exceedingly improved, that had it not met with discouraging Laws, ’twould by this Time have attained&nbsp;to a very great Heigth, and brings great&nbsp;Profit to the Nation; for next to making&nbsp;something out of nothing, is the making&nbsp;something that is Valuable out of what would&nbsp;otherwise be worth nothing; therefore this&nbsp;Art ought to have been handled Charily, to&nbsp;have been Trained up with a great deal of&nbsp;Gentleness, and not loaded with Taxes in&nbsp;its Infancy, by which means we were like to&nbsp;discourage it in the Begining; However it&nbsp;hath still bore up under all the Weight laid&nbsp;upon it; ’Twas a great mistake to appoint&nbsp;Measures by Act of Parliament to the Distillers&nbsp;in their Workings; Mens Knowledge&nbsp;encreases by Observation, and this is the&nbsp;Reason why one Age exceeds another in any&nbsp;sort of Mistery, because they Improve the&nbsp;Notions of those who went before them;&nbsp;Therefore confining the Distillers to Corn&nbsp;only, was an Error, (’Tis true, other Things&nbsp;were allowed to be used, but on such Terms&nbsp;and Restrictions, as were next to a Prohibition) who by degrees would have made&nbsp;Experiments on that themselves, using it with&nbsp;other Mixtures, and thereby drawing from&nbsp;it a cleaner Spirit than it doth of it self afford,&nbsp;which they might in Time have rectified to&nbsp;such a Fineness, as to have encreased very&nbsp;much its Use; No Kingdom can give more&nbsp;Encouragement to Distilling than this, whose&nbsp;Plantations being many, and well Peopled,&nbsp;where those Spirits are so necessary, and useful&nbsp;for the Inhabitants, and these depending&nbsp;wholly on us for all things, would have caused&nbsp;a Consumption of very great Quantities, besides what is used in our Navigation; We have&nbsp;many Materials of our own to Work on, such&nbsp;as are, Molosses, Cyder, Perry, Barley, and&nbsp;others, all which in time they would have&nbsp;Used; for as they found their Sales increased,&nbsp;they would have made New Essays; It was a&nbsp;very wrong Step, to discourage Distilling from&nbsp;Molosses, Scum, Tilts and Wash; an Error&nbsp;the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch,</span><span class="font6"> nor no Trading Nation, would&nbsp;have been guilty of, and proceeded from Ill&nbsp;Advice given the Parliament, by those, who&nbsp;under pretence of advancing Corn, designed&nbsp;to discourage Distilling, only offered it by&nbsp;that handle they thought it would be best&nbsp;received in the House; Trade and Lands go&nbsp;hand in hand as to their Interest, if one&nbsp;Flourishes so will the other; Incourage Distilling, and it will spend Hundreds of things&nbsp;now Thrown away. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Sugar-Baking.</span>Refining of Sugars have given Imployment to our People, and added to their Value&nbsp;in Foreign Markets, where we found great&nbsp;and profitable Sales, till the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">beat us out, occasioned by the Duty of 2 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">s.</span><span class="font6">&nbsp;4 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">d. per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> laid on Muscovado Sugars,&nbsp;1</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> Jac.</span><span class="font6"> 2</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font6"> to be drawn back at Exportation,&nbsp;whereby they were wrought up abroad cheaper&nbsp;then they could be at home; but that Law&nbsp;being now Expired, and the Parliament have&nbsp;since granted a draw back on Refined Sugars&nbsp;when Shipt out, hath very much helpt that&nbsp;Manufacture. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Tobacco.</span>Tobacco also hath imployed our Poor by Cutting and Rowling it, both for a home&nbsp;Consumption, and also for Exportation; but&nbsp;the latter is lessen’d, as the Places, to which&nbsp;we used to export it, work it up themselves. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Tanning.</span>Tanning of Leather is an Employment which deserves to be encourag’d, because it&nbsp;furnishes us with a Commodity, fit to be farther Manufactur’d at home, and also to be&nbsp;transported abroad; I know the Exportation&nbsp;of Leather hath been much opposed by the&nbsp;Shoemakers, and others who cut it at home,&nbsp;and represented as attended with ill&nbsp;Consequences, one whereof is the making it dear;&nbsp;but, Would it not be of much worse to confine and limit that Employment to an Inland Expence? On the other side, would it&nbsp;not naturally follow, that when Leather rises&nbsp;to a great Price, the Exportation must cease,&nbsp;because <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> will undersell us? And would&nbsp;it not seem an unreasonable discouragement to&nbsp;Trade, if Tobacco, Sugar, and the Woollen&nbsp;Manufactures, were debarred from being Exported, only because they should be sold&nbsp;cheaper at home? For suppose the Occasions&nbsp;of the Nation could not consume all the Leather that is made, to what a Low Price must&nbsp;Hides be reduced, for no other Reason, but&nbsp;that the Shoemakers may get more by their&nbsp;Shoes; ’Tis true, if they could make out,&nbsp;that those Countries must then have their&nbsp;Shoes from us, where we now Sell our Leather, I should be of their Minds; But it must&nbsp;needs be otherwise, seeing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> is able to&nbsp;supply them; This proceeds from a very narrow Spirit, and such as ought not to be Encouraged in a Trading Nation; a good Export for Leather, will cause a great Import&nbsp;of Raw-Hides, which will be more Advantage to the Nation, then if they were&nbsp;Tann’d in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, and sent abroad thence. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Minerals.</span>Nor can I omit the several Manufactures made of the sundry Minerals we dig, and render malleable, which would be endless to&nbsp;enumerate, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> of Tin, Lead, Iron and Copper, wherewith we not only furnish enough&nbsp;for our own use, but supply our Plantations,&nbsp;and other Places Abroad, the Workmanship&nbsp;whereof adds much to their Value; and from&nbsp;the last of these we have of late made Brass&nbsp;and Battery; an Undertaking begun by Private&nbsp;Stocks, and carryed on without the help of a&nbsp;Pattent for Fourteen Years, and I am of Opinion, it would be much better for the Nation,&nbsp;if good Projections were Rewarded some other&nbsp;way, and left open, to be Improved by all&nbsp;who were willing to make Experiments at their&nbsp;own Charge; this in all Probability would be&nbsp;a more likely way to bring them to perfection,&nbsp;and in less time, then to tye Men down like&nbsp;the Motions of a Clock, to be directed only&nbsp;by one Leaden Weight; of this we have a&nbsp;late instance in the Project of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Beech Oyl, </span><span class="font6">for if but one half of the Profit can be made&nbsp;thereby, that is set forth by the Ingenious&nbsp;Pattentee, in his Book written on that Subject,&nbsp;against which I see no Objection, if the Computations are rightly Stated, I make no manner of doubt, but that private Stocks would&nbsp;before this time have made a greater progress&nbsp;therein, than hath been done by the&nbsp;present Undertakers, on the Joint Stock; and&nbsp;therefore I think it would be very proper,&nbsp;where such Pattents are Granted, after some&nbsp;reasonable time, to enquire into the Proceedings of the Pattentees, least the Nation&nbsp;be deprived of the Advantages it expected to&nbsp;receive, by the granting those Pattents. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Clockwork.</span>There are many other Things which may be, and daily are improved amongst&nbsp;us; as Clock-work, wherein we sell little but&nbsp;Art and Labour, the Materials whereof they&nbsp;are made being but of small Value; Watches&nbsp;and Clocks of great Prices being sold for the&nbsp;Courts of Foreign Princes. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Paper-Mills.</span>Paper-Mills are a Benefit to the Nation, as they make that Commodity from things of&nbsp;themselves worth little; so are Powder-Mills; <span class="sni">Powder-Mills.</span>also Handicrafts, <span class="sni">Artificers.</span>who supply us with things&nbsp;for our own use, which must otherwise be&nbsp;had from abroad, and also with others, which&nbsp;when Exported, are more or less Profitable,&nbsp;as the Labour of our People adds to their&nbsp;Value, Things being cheaper to us when we&nbsp;pay only for the first Materials whereof they&nbsp;are made, the rest being Work done at Home,&nbsp;is divided amongst our selves; so that on the&nbsp;whole it appears to be the great Interest of&nbsp;this Kingdom to advance its Manufactures; <span class="sni">Methods to improve our Manufactures.</span>and this I humbly conceive may be done&nbsp;these several Ways. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By imploying the Poor.</span>1. By providing Work-Houses for the Poor, and making good Laws, both to Force&nbsp;and Incourage them to Work; But designing&nbsp;to speak larger to this in the Close of this&nbsp;Tract, I shall refer the Reader thereto. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By freeing our Manufactures from Customs.</span>2. By discharging all Customs payable on our Manufactures at their Exportation, and&nbsp;also in the Materials used in making them&nbsp;at their Importation; for as one would Encourage the Merchants to send more abroad,&nbsp;so the other would enable the Manufacturers&nbsp;to afford them cheaper at home; and ’tis&nbsp;strange that a Nation, whose Wealth depends so much on its Manufactures, and whose&nbsp;Interest it is to out do all others, by underselling them in Foreign Markets, should load&nbsp;either with Taxes; but there having been&nbsp;something done in this since my offering it&nbsp;to the consideration of the Parliament in a&nbsp;former Discourse, both as to the Woollen&nbsp;Manufactures Exported, and also to Dye Stuffs&nbsp;Imported, which hath evidently appeared to&nbsp;be an Advantage to our Trade, it may be&nbsp;reasonably hoped, that That Great Council of the&nbsp;Nation will make a farther Progress therein,&nbsp;when it shall come regularly before them;&nbsp;because the Exportation of all our Manufacturers ought to be Encouraged, and not receive a check by any <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Modus</span><span class="font6"> of Raising Money,&nbsp;that so they may be rendred abroad on such&nbsp;Terms, as no other Nation may undersell us;&nbsp;This whole Kingdom being as one great&nbsp;Work-house, wherein if we keep our Poor&nbsp;imployed, they will advance the Value of our&nbsp;Lands, but if we do not, they will become&nbsp;a Load upon them. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Logwood.</span>And here I cannot but mention that of Logwood, a Commodity much used in Dying, which pays Five Pounds <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Tun&nbsp;Custom when Imported, and draws back Three&nbsp;Pounds Fifteen Shillings when Shipt out again,&nbsp;by which means the Dyers in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Holland</span><span class="font6"> use it&nbsp;so much cheaper then ours do here; Now if&nbsp;it was Imported Custom Free, and paid&nbsp;Twenty Five Shillings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Tun at its Exportation, the Dyers there would use it so much&nbsp;dearer than ours; and I think it would be&nbsp;well worth Inquiry, whether a Prohibition,&nbsp;either Total or in Part, of Shipping out our&nbsp;Manufactures thither, and to the Northern&nbsp;Kingdoms, undy’d and undrest, might not be&nbsp;made, I am sure it would be a great Advantage to this Kingdom if it could be done&nbsp;without running into greater Inconveniencies;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch</span><span class="font6"> discourage their being brought in&nbsp;Dyed or Drest, that they may thereby give&nbsp;Imployment to their own People, and&nbsp;encrease their Navigation by the Consumption&nbsp;of Dye-Stuff; the same Reason should prevail with us to Dye and Dress them at home;&nbsp;But this requires the due Consideration of a&nbsp;Committee of Trade, to hear what may be&nbsp;said both for and against it, before it be offered to the Parliament. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By not importing things manufactur’d.</span>3. By discouraging the Importation of Commodities already Manufactured (unless&nbsp;purchased by our own, or by our Product) such&nbsp;as wrought Silks, Callicoes, Brandy, Glass, &amp;c.,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">and encouraging the bringing in the Materials&nbsp;whereof they are made, to be wrought up here;&nbsp;by which means more Ships will be Freighted,&nbsp;and more Sailors imployed, besides the great&nbsp;Advantage to the Nation in the Ballance of its&nbsp;Trade, which must be returned in Bullion, as&nbsp;those Cost less abroad than the other; And this&nbsp;will enable us to afford a greater Consumption&nbsp;of Foreign Commodities to please our Palates,&nbsp;such as Wine, Fruit, and the like, all which&nbsp;fill our Ships, and are fit Subjects for Trade,&nbsp;when they are purchased by our Product and&nbsp;Manufactures, and that the Profit of our&nbsp;Trade will enable the Nation to bear the Expence. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By freeing our Manufactures from Excices.</span>4. By freeing the Manufactures from burthensom Excises, which do much discourage&nbsp;small Stocks, who are not able to carry on&nbsp;their Trades, and make Provision for such&nbsp;great Payments, besides the swarms of Officers, to whom we lay open the Houses of those&nbsp;Men, who deserve all the Encouragement we&nbsp;can give them, and ought to have things made&nbsp;as easy to them as may be; had they been laid&nbsp;on our Woollen Manufactures, as was once&nbsp;hastily proposed, we might have repented it&nbsp;at Leisure; Trade ought to be handled gently, we may tax the Trader, without medling&nbsp;with his Trade; and he that considers the expence of this Nation at Five Pounds <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">Head (accounting only Eight Millions of People) comes to Forty Millions </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Annum, and&nbsp;the Lands only to Twelve or Thirteen, which&nbsp;is more than they can be computed at by the&nbsp;Act of Four Shillings in the Pound, may see&nbsp;how much we are beholding to Trade. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By rendring our Foreign Trade safe and easy.</span>5. By securing the Merchants in their&nbsp;Trades, who export our Product and&nbsp;Manufactures, and making their Business, in relation to the Payment of their Customs, as easy&nbsp;to them as may be: To this end good Convoys should be provided in time of War, and&nbsp;good Crusers maintained to preserve their&nbsp;Ships, it being certain, that whatever is&nbsp;diminished out of the Merchants Stocks, doth so&nbsp;far disable them in their Trades, and consequently&nbsp;lessen their Exports; great care should&nbsp;be taken that the fair Merchants should have the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Modus</span><span class="font6"> of their entries at the&nbsp;Custom-House <span class="sni">Customs.</span>made as easy to them as might&nbsp;be, and a due attendance given at the Loading&nbsp;and discharging their Goods when the Customs&nbsp;are paid, so that they may be dispatcht without Delay, and no unnecessary Remoras put in&nbsp;their way, the loss of one Tide being many&nbsp;times the overthrow of a Voyage;<span class="sni">Courts of Merchants.</span> Courts of Merchants should be erected for the speedy&nbsp;deciding all differences relating to Sea-Affairs,&nbsp;which are better ended by those who understand&nbsp;them, than they are in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Westminster-Hall</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">where all things are tried by the nice Rules of&nbsp;Law, and therefore after much Attendance and&nbsp;Expence, are often referred by the Judges to&nbsp;such as are conversant in Trade; by this&nbsp;means the Merchants would see short ends&nbsp;to their differences; but no general Rules&nbsp;can be given for these Courts, which must be&nbsp;settled, as they suit the Conveniencies of&nbsp;Trading Cities. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By making the Bank more useful.</span>6. By rendering the Bank of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> more applicable to the Incouragement of our Trade&nbsp;than now it is, which I cannot believe the&nbsp;Members of that Corporation will oppose,&nbsp;when it shall manifestly appear, not only to&nbsp;be the Interest of the Nation in General, but&nbsp;also their own. And I humbly conceive that&nbsp;it may be so directed, that every Subject in&nbsp;his particular Station, may receive a Benefit&nbsp;by it. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Ease, Profit, and Security, will keep a Bank always full of Money, the first of which&nbsp;was formerly answered by the private Bankers,&nbsp;who received and paid out Money in the same&nbsp;Manner that the Bank now does, and their&nbsp;Notes generally were as current: But being&nbsp;founded on their own Credits, great Losses&nbsp;often hapned, which gave Shocks to&nbsp;Trade; ’tis true, this Mischief is now guarded&nbsp;against, by the Fund which the Bank of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> hath in the hands of the Government, yet Widdows, Orphans,<span class="sni">Widows and Orphans.</span> and others out of Trade,&nbsp;are not provided for; which might be done,&nbsp;if the Bank did take in what Money might&nbsp;be tendred to them, for such People who are&nbsp;not able to manage it themselves, and to allow&nbsp;an Interest of ### </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent per Annum</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">whilst it continued in their Hands; which tho’&nbsp;it may be below the common Rate, yet by&nbsp;reason of the security, and readiness of Payment, ’twould be preferable to a greater, attended with Hazard and Uncertainties; By&nbsp;this means none of the Money of this Nation would lye dead&nbsp;and useless; And on the other Hand, the Bank&nbsp;might have liberty to lend any Sums at the&nbsp;legal Interest, on this condition, that the&nbsp;Borrower may repay it by such Parts as he can&nbsp;spare it, and be discharged of the Interest of&nbsp;what he so pays in, from the time of its Payment, and from thence forward be chargeable&nbsp;with no more, than doth arise from the Money that remains unpaid. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Remittances.</span>Nor is there such a safe and settled Course of Remittances from place to place as Trade&nbsp;and the other Occasions of the Nation do require; Men often times paying their Money&nbsp;for Bills which are not punctually discharged,&nbsp;and sometimes never, though they give a <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Præmio</span><span class="font6"> to the Drawer, which obliges the Travelling with so much Money, and gives Encouragement to Robbers: But this also might be prevented, if the Bank of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> (that is&nbsp;now settled in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6">) did appoint Chambers&nbsp;in other Places of the Kingdom, at such&nbsp;Distances, as might best suit the Occasions of the&nbsp;Country, and that their Notes given out for&nbsp;Money, either at </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London,</span><span class="font6"> or in any one of&nbsp;those Chambers should be demandable in any&nbsp;other; or by drawing Bills at one Chamber&nbsp;payable in another, the Receiver allowing for&nbsp;such Returns after the Rate of ### </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent. </span> in the Chamber where he receives his Money. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">If the Bank was thus regulated, the Nation would soon see its good Effects; Trustees&nbsp;might place out Orphan’s Money with good&nbsp;Security, and Widows and others, whose&nbsp;Maintenance depends on their Interest, would&nbsp;have it duly paid to answer their Occasions;&nbsp;the whole Cash of the Kingdom would be in&nbsp;a continual Circulation, and not lye dead, as&nbsp;too much of it now does; the Gentry and&nbsp;Traders, who are obliged on many Occasions&nbsp;to take up great Sums at Interest, would&nbsp;have it made easy to them, when they might&nbsp;pay in by such Parts, as they could conveniently&nbsp;spare it; and on the other hand, it&nbsp;would be no Inconvenience to the Bank to receive it, which will by this means never want&nbsp;Borrowers, and their Notes passing in Payment, will circulate instead of Money. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These Methods will prevent many Cheats and Losses, which are often occasion’d by fraudulent and insufficient Drawers, and abate the&nbsp;excessive <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Præmio</span><span class="font6">’s which are demanded by&nbsp;Remitters, when they can take Advantages of&nbsp;Men’s Necessities; and the Taxes receiv’d in&nbsp;the Country might be quicker and safer paid&nbsp;into the Treasury. And if the Bank was&nbsp;likewise extended to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, it would be an&nbsp;Advantage to both Kingdoms, which I shall&nbsp;speak farther to, when I come to discourse of&nbsp;the Trade we drive to that Kingdom. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By increasing the Silver Coin.</span>7. By increasing the Silver Coin of this Kingdom, which are the Tools wherewith the&nbsp;Trader works: It may at first seem strange,&nbsp;that our Silver Coin should grow scarcer, at a&nbsp;Time when we are at Peace with all Nations,&nbsp;our Trade open, and vast Quantities of Bullion yearly imported; but he that considers&nbsp;how much thereof is carry’d away to the<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;East Indies,</span><span class="font6"> and how little Encouragement the Importer hath to send it to the Mint, when he&nbsp;can sell it for more to export, than ’twill&nbsp;come to when Coined, will cease to wonder;&nbsp;and except some Care be taken in this matter, we shall soon be reduced to such Streights,&nbsp;that the Manufacturers must stand still: For&nbsp;though Gold may serve for large Payments, yet&nbsp;it can’t answer the Occasions of the Manufacturers, who are to make their Payments&nbsp;among the Poor. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Now if these or such like Methods were made use of, they might very much encrease&nbsp;our Silver Coin; as </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1. Let the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East-India</span><span class="font6"> Company be limited in the quantity of Bullion they shall Ship out Yearly, whether the Number of Ships&nbsp;they send be few or many; and let them be&nbsp;obliged to carry to the Mint such a suitable&nbsp;Proportion according to what they send away,&nbsp;as to the Wisdom of the Parliament shall&nbsp;seem meet. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2. Let Incouragement be given to all Persons, who shall Voluntarily bring Plate or&nbsp;Bullion to be Coined. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">3. Let the Plate of Orphans be brought into the Mint, which will tend to their Advantage as well as to the Nations; whereas&nbsp;now great Quantities lye dead, and grow out&nbsp;of Fashion before they come to use it, which&nbsp;will by this means, be turned into ready Money, and being put into the Bank, the Interest thereof may be Imployed for their better&nbsp;Maintenance, and the Trade of the Nation&nbsp;will also receive a Benefit thereby: If it be&nbsp;objected, that ’tis now Sold to Goldsmiths, I&nbsp;think this makes the Argument for sending it&nbsp;to the Mint much stronger, because it is much&nbsp;better that it were turned into the Coin of the&nbsp;Kingdom, then disposed of in any other&nbsp;way. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As for Gold, there is no need to give Encouragement to bring it to the Mint, ’tis only a Commodity, and not the Standard, as Silver is; besides, ’tis generally worth more&nbsp;here than in any other Country; and ’tis apparent from the great Quantity thereof which&nbsp;is Coined yearly more than of Silver, that&nbsp;it is every ones Interest to send it thither. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By Discouraging Stock-jobbing.</span>8. By discouraging Stock-jobbing; This hath been the Bane of many good Designs,&nbsp;which began well, and might have been&nbsp;carry’d on to Advantage, if the Promoters had&nbsp;not fallen off by selling their Parts, and slighted the first Design, winding themselves out&nbsp;with Advantage, and leaving the Management to those they had decoy’d in, who&nbsp;understood nothing of the Business, whereby all&nbsp;fell to the Ground; which may be prevented&nbsp;(I mean, so far as concerns Incorporated&nbsp;Stocks) by Laws framed for that end, or&nbsp;by Clauses in their Charters. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By preventing the Exportation of Wool.</span>9. By strengthening the Laws against the Exportation of Wool, by such Practicable&nbsp;Methods as may prevent its being done: For&nbsp;seeing the Nations Interest doth so much depend thereon, no Care can be too great, nor&nbsp;Methods laid too deep: Laws concerning&nbsp;Trade, whose sole Strength are Penalties,&nbsp;rarely reach the thing aimed at; but Practicable Methods, whereby one thing may&nbsp;answer another, and all conspire to carry on&nbsp;the same Design, hanging like so many&nbsp;Links in a Chain, that you cannot reach&nbsp;the one, without stepping over the other,&nbsp;these are more likely to prevent Mischiefs:&nbsp;’Tis one thing to punish People when a Fact&nbsp;is committed, and another to prevent their&nbsp;doing it, by putting them as it were under&nbsp;an Inability; Now where the Welfare of the&nbsp;Kingdom lies so much at Stake, certainly it&nbsp;cannot be thought grievous to compel&nbsp;submission to good Methods, tho’ they may&nbsp;seem troublesome at first. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">The ill Consequences of shipping out our Wool.</span>And that we may the better perceive the Mischiefs that attend the carrying abroad of&nbsp;Wool unwrought to other Nations, let us&nbsp;consider the consequences thereof in what is&nbsp;Shipt to <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France;</span><span class="font6"> whose Wool being very&nbsp;coarse, and fit only for Rugs and Blankets,&nbsp;and such ordinary Cloath, is by mixture with&nbsp;ours and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Irish</span><span class="font6">, used in the making of many&nbsp;sorts of Stuffs and Druggets, whereby the&nbsp;Sales of our Woollen Manufactures are&nbsp;lessened, both there, and in other places whither&nbsp;we Export them; and by this means, every&nbsp;Pack of Wool sent thither, works up two&nbsp;besides it self, being chiefly Combed, and&nbsp;combing Wool, which makes Wool for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> Wool, and the Pinions thereof serve&nbsp;with their Linnen to make coarse Druggets,&nbsp;like our Linsey-Woolsey, but the Linnen being Spun Fine, and Coloured, is not easily&nbsp;discerned; also our Finest Short Wool, being&nbsp;mixt with the lowest </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6">, makes a middling sort of Broad-Cloth, and being Woven&nbsp;on Worsted Chains, makes their best Druggets, neither of which could be done with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> Wool only, unless in conjunction with&nbsp;ours or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Irish</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6"> Wool being too fine and&nbsp;too Short for Worsted Stuffs, and unfit for&nbsp;Combing, so that without one of those two&nbsp;Sorts, there cannot be a Piece of Worsted&nbsp;Stuff or middle Broad-Cloth made; no&nbsp;other Wool but </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">English</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Irish</span><span class="font6"> will mix well&nbsp;with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6"> for Cloth, being originally Raised&nbsp;from a Stock of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">English</span><span class="font6"> Sheep, the difference,&nbsp;arising from the Nature of the Land whereon&nbsp;they are Fed;

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As for the Wool of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">North-Britain</span><span class="font6">, I am not sufficiently verst therein, to give a true&nbsp;Account of the Nature of it. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Methods to prevent the Exportation of Wooll.</span>I know many Methods have been thought of to prevent this pernicious Mischief, but all&nbsp;the Laws I have yet seen, seem to reach but&nbsp;half way, they depend too much on Force&nbsp;and Penalties, and too little on Method; we&nbsp;must begin deeper, and secure the Wool from&nbsp;the time of its Growing, till ’tis wrought up&nbsp;into Manufactures, and I think nothing less&nbsp;than a Register, to be kept in every County,&nbsp;will do it. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor will This be attended with so much Trouble and Charge to the Nation in General,&nbsp;or to private Persons in particular, as may at&nbsp;first be Thought: The time of Sheering being but once a Year, those who keep Sheep, may&nbsp;give notice to the Officer appointed for that&nbsp;District, of the Number of Sheep they have&nbsp;to Sheer, and the day whereon they intend to&nbsp;do it, that so he may be present to see the&nbsp;Fleeces Weighed, and to charge them therewith; which charge must remain upon them&nbsp;till they sell their Wool, and give notice&nbsp;thereof to the Office, when the next Buyer&nbsp;must be charged, and so <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">toties quoties</span><span class="font6">, till it&nbsp;comes into the hands of him that works it&nbsp;up; And all this may be done by the Officers&nbsp;of the Excise, in such a manner, as may cost&nbsp;the Nation little. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And to prevent Frauds, let no parcel of Wool above such a Weight as the Parliament shall think fit, be carried from place&nbsp;to place, but in the Day time, nor without&nbsp;a Letpass, or Cocket, setting forth from whence&nbsp;it came, and whither it is going; and the same&nbsp;Method must also be extended to <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, till&nbsp;it is either used there, or Shipt thither; And&nbsp;if the Wool of both Kingdoms by these or&nbsp;any other Methods could be secured from being&nbsp;carried abroad, our Manufactures would find&nbsp;a surer Vent in Foreign Markets, and yield&nbsp;better Prices: And the Wool of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font6"> would&nbsp;lye on their Hands, and become almost&nbsp;useless; the Credit of the Nation would be raised,&nbsp;and our Factories abroad courted as much as&nbsp;formerly they have been, because the Manufactures we Ship out are such, as no Nation&nbsp;can be without, nor can they then be well&nbsp;supplied elsewhere; they are not things only&nbsp;for Pleasure, but for Use, and both the Rich&nbsp;and the Poor stand in need of them; whilst&nbsp;the Profit of this pernicious Practice of Shipping out the Wool, is sunk in the Pockets of&nbsp;private Men, who former Laws accounted&nbsp;Felons, and cannot be thought to deserve any&nbsp;favour from the Nation. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Besides, ’tis well known, that the Exporting our Wool hath by the ill Consequences thereof abated its Price at Home; This hath&nbsp;been observed by Calculations made by&nbsp;considerate Men; and the Reason is, because&nbsp;those Countreys whither it is Shipt, being&nbsp;thereby enabled to Work up much larger&nbsp;Quantities of their own, the Sale of our Manufactures are grown slack abroad, and we&nbsp;have been forced to Sell them cheaper, which&nbsp;beat down the Prices both of Wool and Labour; whereas, if we had kept our Wool at&nbsp;Home, this had been prevented; And it must&nbsp;be allowed, that it was not our Interest to fall&nbsp;our Manufactures, if we had been the only&nbsp;Sellers; for according as they yield in Price,&nbsp;so is the Wealth of the Nation advanced,&nbsp;which our Forefathers well knew, when they&nbsp;made Laws to prohibit the Exportation of&nbsp;Wool, which cannot be too much strengthned,&nbsp;or strongly put in Execution. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">By managing Treaties of Peace to the Advantage of Trade.</span>10. By taking Care, that in all Treaties of&nbsp;Peace, and other Negotiations with Foreign&nbsp;Princes, due Regard be had to our Trade&nbsp;and Manufactures; That our Merchants be&nbsp;well treated by the Governments where they&nbsp;reside; That all things be made easy to them,&nbsp;and both their Liberties and Properties&nbsp;secured; That our Manufactures be not Prohibited, or Burthened with unreasonable Taxes,&nbsp;which is the same in Effect; That speedy Justice&nbsp;be done in recovering Debts contracted&nbsp;amongst the Natives, and punishing Abuses&nbsp;put on our Factories by them; These are&nbsp;pressures our Trade hath formerly groaned&nbsp;under, whereby the Merchants abroad, and&nbsp;Manufacturers at home, have been much&nbsp;discouraged, and the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">English</span><span class="font6"> Nation hath been&nbsp;forced to truckle under the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> in some&nbsp;Foreign Parts, only because that King sooner&nbsp;resented Injuries done to his Trading Subjects,&nbsp;and took more care to demand Reparation,&nbsp;than some former Reigns have done; But&nbsp;Thanks be to God, we have both Power and&nbsp;Opportunity to do the same; and there is&nbsp;no cause to doubt His Majesties Royal Inclinations, to make use of Both for the Good&nbsp;of his Merchants, when things are duly represented to Him. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Navigation.</span>And thus I have run through the several Parts of our Inland Trade, and shewed, that the Profit thereof arises chiefly from our Product and Manufactures; Before I proceed to&nbsp;our Foreign Trade, I shall speak something&nbsp;of Navigation, which is the Medium between both: This is carried on by Ships and&nbsp;Sailors, the former are the Sea-Waggons,&nbsp;whereby we Transport and carry Commodities&nbsp;from one Market to another, and the latter&nbsp;are the Waggoners who drive and manage&nbsp;them; These are a sort of Jolly Fellows, who&nbsp;are generally Bold in their Undertakings, and&nbsp;go through any Kind of Labour in their own&nbsp;way, with a great deal of Cheerfulness, are&nbsp;undaunted by Storms and Tempests, the Sea&nbsp;being as it were their Element, and are allow’d by all to be the best Navigators in the&nbsp;World; they are our Wealth in Peace, and&nbsp;our Defence in War, and ought to be more&nbsp;encouraged than they are in both, but especially&nbsp;in the latter, which might be done, if&nbsp;better Methods were used to engage them in&nbsp;the Service, and better Treatment when they&nbsp;are there; Now I should think, if no Man&nbsp;was forced into the Kings Ships till he had&nbsp;been Three Years at Sea,<span class="sni">Manning our Ships of War.</span> nor to stay there&nbsp;above that time without his free Consent,&nbsp;and then to be permitted to take a Merchants Imployment so much longer, and so<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;toties quoties</span><span class="font6">, ’twould Encourage them to&nbsp;come willingly into the Service, which they&nbsp;look upon now to be a Slavery, whereto&nbsp;they are bound for their Lives; This, and&nbsp;the manner of Pressing them, hinders very&nbsp;much the making of Sailors, Landmen not&nbsp;caring to put their hands to the Oar, lest&nbsp;the next Day they should be halled away to&nbsp;the Fleet, tho’ they understand nothing of&nbsp;the Sea; By this Means our Men of War&nbsp;would be Man’d with able Seamen, and not&nbsp;with such who only stand in the way, and&nbsp;are useless, when they are most wanted; Nor&nbsp;do I take Embargoes to be any helps towards it, for many Sailors do then lye hid,&nbsp;who would appear to serve in Merchant Ships,&nbsp;and might be easily met with at the return&nbsp;of their Voyages; By these means in a short&nbsp;time there would be a double set of Mariners, enough both for the Service of the Fleet&nbsp;and of Trade, the last of which would every&nbsp;Year breed more. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">This would also prevent great Mischiefs, which arise from pressing Sailors out of Merchants Ships whilst on their Voyages, many&nbsp;of them being thereby lost at Sea, and others&nbsp;have been detained in the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">West-Indies</span><span class="font6">, to the&nbsp;discouragement of Trade; And it would also&nbsp;prevent an other Mischief, too much Practiced&nbsp;abroad, where Captains of Men of War press </span>Sailors from one Merchant Ship, only to make Advantage by Selling them to another. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Outland Trade.</span>I come now to our Outland Trade, or the Trade we drive with Foreign Countries. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">How this Kingdom may be said to be enrich’d by our Outland Trade.</span>Here ’tis necessary to enquire, how each doth encourage our Product and Manufactures,&nbsp;how our Navigation, what Commodities we&nbsp;receive in Returns, and how the Ballance of&nbsp;our Trade stands with either, that so we may&nbsp;be the better able to know, which of them we&nbsp;ought to encourage, and which to discourage;&nbsp;I shall therefore lay down such general Rules,&nbsp;as I presume will be allowed by all Unbiassed&nbsp;Persons; as, </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1. That Trade is an Advantage to this Kingdom, which takes off our Product and&nbsp;Manufactures. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2. Which supplies us with such Commodities as we use in making our Manufactures, and encreases our Bullion. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">3. Which Incourages Navigation, and breeds up Sailors. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And consequently, any Trade which Exports little or none of our Product or Manufactures, nor supplies us with things necessary for the latter, nor Incourages Navigation, cannot be supposed to be profitable to the Kingdom&nbsp;in General, tho’ perhaps it may be&nbsp;so to particular Persons; especially if it carries&nbsp;away our Bullion. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">East-Indies.</span>I shall begin with the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East-India</span><span class="font6"> Trade, which I take to be very prejudical to us, as&nbsp;’tis now driven; because it exports our Bullion,&nbsp;spends little of our Product or Manufactures,&nbsp;and brings in Commodities perfectly Manufactured, which hinder the Consumption of&nbsp;our own, and discourage the Wearing such as&nbsp;are purchased with them; the chief Profit&nbsp;thereof arising from Underselling the Labour&nbsp;of our Poor, because ’tis bought there cheaper, than by reason of the Value of our Lands,&nbsp;and the Prices of Provisions, they are able to&nbsp;work here. But having spoken fully of this&nbsp;in a former Discourse, and the Parliament having since been pleased, by an Act made in&nbsp;the 10th and 11th Years of his late Majesty&nbsp;King </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">William</span><span class="font6">, to prohibit the Wearing of&nbsp;wrought Silks, Bengals, Stuffs mixt with Silk&nbsp;or Herba, of the Manufacture of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Persia</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;China</span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">India</span><span class="font6">, and all Callicoes Painted,&nbsp;Dy’d, Printed or Stained there. The Reason&nbsp;of which is in the said Act set forth to be,&nbsp;The great Detriment the Nation received as&nbsp;the Trade was then manag’d, by exhausting&nbsp;the Treasure thereof, and taking away the&nbsp;Labour of the People, whereby very many&nbsp;of the Manufacturers were become excessively&nbsp;burthensome and chargeable to their respective&nbsp;Parishes, and others compell’d to seek for&nbsp;Employment in Foreign Parts, I shall not now&nbsp;repeat what I then wrote, but will consider&nbsp;how far the Remedy they then provided hath&nbsp;answer’d the End. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The making this Law gave a new Life to our Manufactures, and would have given&nbsp;more, if the true Intent of the Parliament&nbsp;had been answered: But we have since found&nbsp;that it has not; for it neither keeps our&nbsp;Treasure at home, nor prevents those Commodities&nbsp;from being worn here, which they design’d&nbsp;it should; and I very much question, whether&nbsp;any thing less than a total Prohibition of their&nbsp;Importation will do it; for though they are&nbsp;directed to be Exported again, yet there is&nbsp;great Reason to believe, that they are privately&nbsp;brought back, both from <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, our Plantations, and other Places to which they are&nbsp;sent, to the Loss of his Majesty’s Customs,&nbsp;and the Prejudice of the Stainers and Painters here, besides the Injury to our Manufactures:&nbsp;Otherwise, how come such great Quantities to&nbsp;be worn and used here, when the Stock on&nbsp;hand hath been so long since spent? </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">There are other Commodities, which the Company may trade in, and the Tract of&nbsp;Land within their Charter is large enough to&nbsp;afford an advantagious Commerce there, the&nbsp;Profits whereof might be returned hither, in&nbsp;things no way injurious to our Manufactures,&nbsp;such as Raw-Silk, Indigo, Pepper, Salt-Peter,&nbsp;Spices, Drugs, China-Wares, Coffee, Tea,&nbsp;and many other things, if they were industrious to make Discoveries, as private Merchants would do, if the Trade lay open; and&nbsp;I believe it will not be disputed, that greater&nbsp;Quantities of Raw-Silk, have been brought&nbsp;thence since the Making of that Law, than&nbsp;were used to be done before. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I know it hath been alleadg’d, That by the Exportation of those Manufactures again,&nbsp;more Bullion in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">specie</span><span class="font6"> is brought into this&nbsp;Kingdom, than is carry’d out for the buying&nbsp;them in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">India</span><span class="font6">; but this was never yet made&nbsp;out, and it would be much to the Satisfaction&nbsp;of the People, who daily see their Bullion carried away, and also for the Honour of the&nbsp;Company, that it was done; which if it be&nbsp;really so, might be set forth in this, or any&nbsp;other Method that the Parliament shall think&nbsp;fit. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1. Let them give an Account what Quantities of Bullion they export on every Ship they send abroad, and on what Commodities&nbsp;’tis laid out. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2. Let them set forth, how and in what manner, these prohibited Manufactures do, on&nbsp;their being Exported again, bring in as much&nbsp;Bullion in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">specie</span><span class="font6">, as was carry’d out to pay for&nbsp;them in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Indies. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And I think it a proper Work for a Committee of Trade, to receive these Accounts from time to time, and after a just Examination, to lay them before the Parliament at&nbsp;every Meeting, with their Opinions thereon. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But if they only mean, that the Exportation of those Manufactures is a help to us in the Ballance of our Trade, which must otherwise&nbsp;be paid in Bullion, I answer, That our&nbsp;own Product and Manufactures always have,&nbsp;and are still sufficent to support the Ballance&nbsp;of our Trade. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As for White Callicoes and Muslins, they have beat out the Wearing of Lawns, Cambricks,&nbsp;and other thin <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Germany</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Silesia</span><span class="font6"> Linnens,&nbsp;which hath been the Occasion of turning&nbsp;many of those Looms to the Woollen Manufactures there, that were formerly employ’d&nbsp;in the weaving them, and hath abated the&nbsp;Exportation of great Quantities of Cloth;&nbsp;Besides the Hinderance Callicoes give to the&nbsp;Consumption of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scots</span><span class="font6">-Linnens, which being&nbsp;thin and soft, are as proper for dying, printing, and staining, as they are, and may be&nbsp;made as white. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East Indies</span><span class="font6"> is a bottomless Pit for our Bullion, which can never circulate hither again;&nbsp;whereas, if it was sent to any Part of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">there might be some hopes, by the Ballance&nbsp;of our Trade, to bring it back again; and&nbsp;when our Bullion fails, that Trade must cease&nbsp;of course, which it will soon do, if the Company continue to carry out yearly as much as&nbsp;our other Trades bring us in. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I wish the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom would be in Love with our own&nbsp;Manufactures, and those which are purchased&nbsp;with them, and that they would by their Examples encourage the using them, which&nbsp;would be attended with the Prayers of the&nbsp;Poor, besides the Advantage it would bring&nbsp;to their Estates. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And as to Navigation, I think it will not be disputed, that long Voyages rather use&nbsp;Saylors than make them, both the Employers,&nbsp;and the Employed, chusing rather to make&nbsp;their first Experiments on short ones. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">West-India and Africa.</span>I will next proceed to the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">West-India</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">African</span><span class="font6"> Trades, which I esteem the most profitable we drive, and joyn them together, because&nbsp;of their dependance on each other. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Whether Settling of Plantations hath been an Advantage.</span>But before I enter farther thereon, I will consider of one Objection, it having been a&nbsp;great Question among many thoughtful Men,&nbsp;whether the settling our Plantations Abroad&nbsp;has been an Advantage to the Nation; The&nbsp;Reasons they give against them are, That&nbsp;they have drained us of Multitudes of our&nbsp;People, who might have been serviceable at&nbsp;Home, and advanced Improvements in Husbandry and Manufactures; That this Kingdom&nbsp;is worse Peopled, by so much as they are&nbsp;increased; And that Inhabitants being the&nbsp;Wealth of a Nation, by how much they are&nbsp;lessened, by so much we are Poorer, than&nbsp;when we first began to settle those Colonies. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">To all which I answer; That tho’ I allow the last Proposition to be true, that&nbsp;People are the Wealth of a Nation, yet it&nbsp;can only be so, where we find Imployment&nbsp;for them, otherwise they must be a Burthen&nbsp;to it: ’Tis my Opinion that our Plantations&nbsp;are an Advantage to this Kingdom, tho'&nbsp;not all alike, but every one more or less, as&nbsp;they take off our Product and Manufactures, supply us with Commodities, which may be&nbsp;either wrought up here, or exported again, or&nbsp;prevent fetching things of the same Nature&nbsp;from other Places for our Home Consumption,&nbsp;employ our Poor, and encourage our Navigation; For I take this Kingdom, and all its&nbsp;Plantations, to be one Great Body, those being&nbsp;as so many Limbs or Counties belonging to&nbsp;it; therefore when we consume their Growth,&nbsp;we do as it were spend the Fruits of our&nbsp;own Land; and what thereof we Sell to our&nbsp;Neighbours, brings a second Profit to the&nbsp;Nation. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These Plantations are either the great Continent from Hudsons-Bay<span class="font6"> Northward to&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Florida</span><span class="font6"> Southward, containing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nova Scotia</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;New-England</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New-Jersy</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New-York</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;Pensilvania</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Virginia</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mary-Land</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Carolina</span><span class="font6">; and&nbsp;also our Islands, the Chief whereof are, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Newfoundland</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Barbadoes</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Antegoa</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nevis</span><span class="font6">, St.</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;Christophers</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Montserat</span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jamaica</span><span class="font6">; the&nbsp;Commodities they afford us are more especially,&nbsp;Sugars, Cotton, Tobacco, Piamento and&nbsp;Fustick, of their own Growth; also Logwood, which we bring from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jamaica</span><span class="font6"> (but&nbsp;first brought thither from the Bay of</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;Campechia</span><span class="font6"> on the Continent of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mexico</span><span class="font6">, belonging to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spaniards</span><span class="font6">, but cut by the Subjects&nbsp;of this Kingdom, who have made small settlements&nbsp;there) besides great Quantities of Fish&nbsp;taken on the Coasts, both of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Newfoundland</span><span class="font6"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New-England</span><span class="font6">; These being the Product of&nbsp;Earth, Sea and Labour, are clear Profit to&nbsp;the Kingdom, and give a double Employment to our People, first to those who raise&nbsp;them there, next to those who prepare Manufactures here, wherewith they are supplied,&nbsp;besides the Advantage they afford to our&nbsp;Navigation; for the Commodities Exported thither, and those Imported thence hither, being&nbsp;generally bulky, do thereby Imploy more&nbsp;Ships, and consequently more Sailors, which&nbsp;leaves more Room for other Labouring People&nbsp;to be kept at Work in our Husbandry and&nbsp;Manufactures, whilst they consume the Product of the one, and the Effects of the other,&nbsp;in an Imployment of a distinct Nature from&nbsp;either. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">This was the first Design of settling Plantations Abroad, that we might better maintain a Commerce and Trade among our selves, the Profit whereof might redound to the Center: And therefore Laws were made to prevent the carrying their Product to other Places, and their being supply’d with Necessaries&nbsp;save from hence only, and both to be done&nbsp;in our own Ships, Navigated by our own&nbsp;Sailors, except in some Cases permitted by the&nbsp;Act of Navigation; and so much as the Reins&nbsp;of those Laws are let loose, so much less Profitable are the Plantations to us. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Among these Plantations, I look upon <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New-England</span><span class="font6"> to bring the least Advantage to&nbsp;this Kingdom; for the Inhabitants thereof,&nbsp;Employing themselves rather by Trading to the&nbsp;others, than raising a Product proper to be&nbsp;Transported hither, and supplying them (especially&nbsp;the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Islands</span>) with Fish (which they&nbsp;catch on their Coast) Deal-Boards, Pipe-Staves,&nbsp;Horses, and such like things of their&nbsp;own Growth, which they cannot be so well&nbsp;Furnished with hence, also with Bread, Flower, Pease, and other Grain; and from thence&nbsp;fetching the respective Products of those&nbsp;Islands, and sometimes Tobacco from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Virginia</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mary-Land</span><span class="font6">, have carried them to&nbsp;Foreign Markets, to the great Prejudice of&nbsp;this Kingdom; But to prevent this, they&nbsp;have been by sundry Laws obliged to bring&nbsp;them all hither, except what is consumed&nbsp;among themselves; By which means this&nbsp;Kingdom is become the Center of Trade,&nbsp;and standing like the Sun in the midst of&nbsp;its Plantations, doth not only refresh them, but also draws Profit from them; And indeed it is a matter of exact Justice that it&nbsp;should be so, for from hence it is that Fleets&nbsp;of Ships, and Regiments of Soldiers are&nbsp;frequently sent for their Defence, at the charge&nbsp;of the Inhabitants, towards which they contribute but little. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Besides the forementioned Commodities, we have from <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Carolina</span><span class="font6">, Excellent Rice, and&nbsp;there has been Cocheneel taken, which as yet&nbsp;is but a Discovery, and perhaps may not&nbsp;meet with any considerable Improvement, till&nbsp;That Colony is better Peopled; what I have&nbsp;seen thereof in the hands of a Gentleman who&nbsp;brought it thence, seems by its Figure, to be&nbsp;much like what we call a Lady-Cow, or Lady-Bird,&nbsp;but is very small, and I take it to be the&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fœtus</span><span class="font6"> of an Insect, which laying its Eggs on&nbsp;a Shrub called the Prickle-Pear, or something&nbsp;very like it, leaves them there, till time&nbsp;brings them to Maturity, in the same manner as the Caterpillar does with us in the Cabbage or Collard Leaves, Wise Nature thus directing, that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fœtus</span><span class="font6"> may find its Food, so&nbsp;soon as it wants its Sustenance; It gives a&nbsp;very curious Colour when Bruised, but being&nbsp;extraordinary small, does require long time&nbsp;to gather in any Quantity, and Labour being&nbsp;very dear there, ’twill not yet answer the&nbsp;Charge; but by Cultivating and Improving&nbsp;the Plant, which now grows Wild, and by&nbsp;being better acquainted with the proper Season&nbsp;to collect them, when they are at a more&nbsp;Mature Growth, greater Quantities may probably hereafter be procured, and at less&nbsp;Charge; and I think it would be a good step&nbsp;towards it, if an Incouragement was given&nbsp;on its Importation hither, in such a manner,&nbsp;as to the Wisdom of the Parliament shall&nbsp;seem fit and proper. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Africa.</span>Now, That which makes these Plantations more Profitable to this Kingdom, is the Trade&nbsp;to <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Africa,</span><span class="font6"> whereby the Planters are supplied&nbsp;with Negroes for their Use and Service; a&nbsp;Trade of the most Advantage of any we&nbsp;drive, and as it were all Profit, the first Cost&nbsp;being some things of our own Manufactures,&nbsp;and others generally purchased with them, for&nbsp;which we have in Return, Gold, Teeth, Wax,&nbsp;and Negroes, the last whereof is indeed the&nbsp;best Traffick the Kingdom hath, as it occasionally&nbsp;gives so vast an Imployment to our&nbsp;People both by Sea and Land; These are&nbsp;the Hands whereby our Plantations are improved, and ’tis by their Labours such great&nbsp;Quantities of Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Ginger, Fustick and Indigo, are raised, which&nbsp;Imploy great Numbers of Ships for transporting&nbsp;them hither; and the greater Number of Ships, Imploys the greater Number of&nbsp;Handicrafts Trades at home, spends more of&nbsp;our Product and Manufactures, and makes&nbsp;more Sailors, who are maintained by a&nbsp;separate Imployment; for if every one raised the&nbsp;Provisions he Eat, or made the Manufactures&nbsp;he Wore, Traffick would cease, which is a variety of Imployments Men have set themselves on, whereby one is serviceable to another, adapted to their particular Genius’s,&nbsp;without invading each others Provinces;&nbsp;Thus the Husbandman raises Corn, the Miller grinds it, the Baker makes it into Bread,&nbsp;and the Citizen Eats it; Thus the Grasier Fats&nbsp;Cattle, and the Butcher Kills them for the&nbsp;Market; Thus the Shepherd Sheers his Sheep,&nbsp;the Spinster turns the Wool into Yarn, the&nbsp;Weaver makes it into Cloth, and the Merchant exports it, and every one lives by each&nbsp;other; Thus the Country supplies the City&nbsp;with Provisions, and That the Country with&nbsp;Necessaries; Now the advising a former Reign&nbsp;to monopolize this Trade, and confine it to&nbsp;an exclusive Company, was the same, as to&nbsp;advise the People of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ægypt</span><span class="font6">, to raise high&nbsp;Banks to keep the River </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nilus</span><span class="font6"> from overflowing, lest it should fertilize their Lands,&nbsp;or the King of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6"> to shut up his Mines,&nbsp;least he should fill his Kingdom too full of&nbsp;Silver; This Trade indeed is our Silver Mine,&nbsp;for by the Overplus of Negroes above what&nbsp;will serve our Plantations, we draw great&nbsp;Quantities thereof from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spaniards</span><span class="font6"> who&nbsp;are settled on the Continent of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6">, both&nbsp;for the Negroes we furnish from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jamaica</span><span class="font6">, and&nbsp;also by the Assiento, lately settled by a compact of both Nations; ’Twas these which first&nbsp;introduced our Commerce with that People,&nbsp;and gave us Opportunities of Selling our Manufactures to them. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But tho’ this Trade be now laid open, yet it will not be amiss to enquire what&nbsp;Reasons should perswade That Government to Monopolize it, and what has been the Consequences&nbsp;thereof, in order to obviate any future Attempts that may be made to get it&nbsp;done again. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As for the First; The necessity of having Forts, Castles, and Soldiers to defend the&nbsp;Trade which could not be carried on without&nbsp;them, had then Force enough to prevail. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But let us consider what these Forts, Castles, and Soldiers were, their Use, and&nbsp;whither the Trade is not as well secured now&nbsp;it lies open. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The greatest Number of Soldiers, offer’d as I remember at a Committee formerly appointed by the Honourable House of Commons to enquire into that Affair, did not exceed One Hundred and Twenty on the whole&nbsp;Coast, nor did their Forts and Castles appear&nbsp;to be any thing else than Settlements for their&nbsp;Factors, nor was it ever made out, or indeed&nbsp;pretended, that they were fitted to wage a&nbsp;National War, or to secure against a National&nbsp;Invasion, nor were there any Magazines laid&nbsp;up to expect a Siege from the Natives; nor&nbsp;could they hinder Interlopers from Trading&nbsp;on the Coast, of what Nation soever, but the&nbsp;Company having obtained Frigats from the&nbsp;Government, destroyed our own Merchant&nbsp;Ships (unless permitted on the Payment of&nbsp;great Mulcts at Home) whilst they let others&nbsp;alone; This together with the Powers given&nbsp;them in their Charter, to Seize in the Plantations, such as had the good Fortune to escape&nbsp;them on the Coast, and also their Cargoes,&nbsp;discouraged Private Traders, who else found&nbsp;no Difficulties, the Natives receiving them as&nbsp;Friends, and chusing rather to deal with them&nbsp;than the Company, whose Factories also being at remote Distances from each other, great&nbsp;part of that Coast was untraded to. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor do I see what Need there was to fight our way into a Trade, altogether as advantagious&nbsp;to the Natives as to us; for whilst we&nbsp;supplied them with things they wanted, and&nbsp;were of Value amongst them, we took in exchange Slaves, which were else of little Worth&nbsp;to the Proprietors; and there was no reason&nbsp;to think, that the People of this Kingdom,&nbsp;who had settled such large Colonies on the&nbsp;Continent of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6">, (besides its several&nbsp;Islands) where there was at first such small&nbsp;Hopes of Advantage, without the Help of a&nbsp;Company, should fall short in securing this&nbsp;Trade, which carried with it the Prospect of&nbsp;so great a Profit. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I will next consider the Inconveniencies that have attended this Monopoly, and the&nbsp;Advantage the Nation reaps by the Trades&nbsp;being laid open; we now send more Ships,&nbsp;and supply the Plantations with more Negroes, and vend more of our Commodities&nbsp;for their Purchase: Besides, every Negro in&nbsp;the Plantations gives a second Employ to the&nbsp;Manufacturers of this Kingdom; and had we&nbsp;many more to spare, the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spaniards</span><span class="font6"> would buy&nbsp;them, and pay us in Bullion, so there could&nbsp;be no Ground for putting this Trade into few&nbsp;Hands, unless ’twas designed those few should&nbsp;grow Rich, whilst for their sakes the Nation suffered in its Trade and Navigation, the&nbsp;Company having made this detrimental Use&nbsp;of their Charter, that they bought up our&nbsp;Manufactures cheaper at home, and made the&nbsp;Planters pay dearer for Negroes abroad, than&nbsp;could have been done, if there had been&nbsp;more Buyers for the One, and Sellers of the&nbsp;Other. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">It is not to be doubted, whether the Vending our Manufactures, and Encouraging our Navigation, on Advantagious Terms, are the&nbsp;true Interest of this Kingdom, and that all&nbsp;Foreign Commerce, as it advances either, is&nbsp;more or less profitable to us; but the confining this Trade to an Exclusive Company could&nbsp;promote neither; and I believe ’tis one great&nbsp;Reason, why we know so little of that great&nbsp;Continent, because the Company, finding&nbsp;Ways enough to employ their Stock amongst&nbsp;those few Settlements they had made on the&nbsp;Sea-Coast, never endeavoured a farther Inland&nbsp;Discovery; whereas, now the Trade is laid&nbsp;open, the busy Merchant, that industrious&nbsp;Bee of the Nation, will not leave any Creek&nbsp;or River untraded to, from whence he may&nbsp;hope to make Advantage. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">’Tis to Trade and Commerce we are beholding for what knowledge we have of Foreign Parts, and it is observable, that the&nbsp;more remote People dwell from the Sea, the&nbsp;less they are acquainted with Affairs abroad.&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Africa</span><span class="font6"> is a large Country, and doubtless the&nbsp;Trade to it may be much enlarged to our&nbsp;Advantage; Use and Experience make us by&nbsp;degrees Masters of every thing, and tho’ the&nbsp;first Undertakers of a Design may fall short&nbsp;of answering their private Ends, yet they often&nbsp;lay open Beaten Paths, wherein Posterity do&nbsp;tread with Success, tho’ they miscarried:&nbsp;Now that all Places are permitted freely to&nbsp;send Ships, and to have the Management of&nbsp;their own Affairs, Industry is encourag’d, and&nbsp;Peoples Heads are set at Work how they may&nbsp;out-do each other, by getting first into a new&nbsp;Place of Trade. Besides, the more Traders,&nbsp;the more Buyers at home, and Sellers abroad,&nbsp;and by this means, our Plantations on the&nbsp;large Continent of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6"> are better&nbsp;furnish’d with Negroes, for want of which the&nbsp;Inhabitants there could never arrive to those&nbsp;Improvements they have done on the Islands, the Company having given them little or no&nbsp;Supply, but chose rather to send their Negroes&nbsp;to the latter, because they were able to make&nbsp;them better Payments; but the Free-Traders&nbsp;have since done it, to the great Advantage of&nbsp;those Plantations, and of the Nation in general. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As for the other Commodities brought in Returns from <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Africa</span><span class="font6">, </span>viz.<span class="font6"> Wax and Teeth,&nbsp;one serves for a Foreign Export, without any&nbsp;Disadvantage to our own Product; and the&nbsp;other is Manufactured at home, and afterwards&nbsp;carried to Markets abroad: And as for the&nbsp;Gold brought thence, I need not mention how&nbsp;much it doth advance our Wealth, all allow it&nbsp;to be a good Barter. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">On the whole, I take the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">African</span><span class="font6"> Trade, both for its Exports and Imports, and also as&nbsp;it supplies our Plantations, and advances Navigation, to be very beneficial to this Kingdom, and will every Year grow more so, if it&nbsp;remains open. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Ireland.</span>I now come to discourse of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, and of the Trade we interchangeably drive with that&nbsp;Kingdom, with whom it is necessary to maintain a good Correspondence, which must be&nbsp;done on such Terms, as may be profitable to&nbsp;us both; and I think nothing is more likely&nbsp;to answer this End, than the encouraging the&nbsp;Linnen Manufacture there, which it is highly&nbsp;our Interest to promote, and theirs to set upon,&nbsp;being for the most part of another Nature,&nbsp;than what is made either in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">North</span><span class="font6"> or</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;South-Britain</span><span class="font6">; for, besides the Employment it will&nbsp;give to their Poor, large Tracts of Land will&nbsp;be taken up for raising Hemp and Flax, both&nbsp;which thrive well in many Parts of that Kingdom; on the other hand, the low Labour of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> being employed on that Manufacture,&nbsp;will no way prejudice ours, but make them&nbsp;better able to trade with us, for such things&nbsp;wherewith they are supplied hence, it being&nbsp;undoubtedly the Interest of this Kingdom,&nbsp;that all those Nations we trade with should&nbsp;grow Rich, by any Methods that do not make&nbsp;us Poor; and more especially </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, whose&nbsp;Profits are generally spent here. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But then how shall this Manufacture be carried on? truly the first Step must be, by&nbsp;furnishing Money on reasonable Interest, and&nbsp;receiving it again by such Payments as the&nbsp;Borrowers can make, and buying up the Linnens&nbsp;when made, and then the Landed Men&nbsp;will encourage it, on their own Estates, and&nbsp;thereby enable their Tenants to pay their&nbsp;Rents better; Which last Effect it hath already&nbsp;had in the North of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, where by spinning&nbsp;the Yarn in the Winter Nights, and getting&nbsp;their Cloth ready, and fit for Sale, early in&nbsp;the Year, they provide for their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">May</span><span class="font6"> Rents,&nbsp;without being constrained to sell their Cattle&nbsp;whilst they are lean, and their </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">November</span><span class="font6"> Payments do not become due, till they are fat,&nbsp;and their Harvest is over. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Now these Loans must be made, either by a Joint-Stock raised for that Purpose, or by&nbsp;the Bank of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">, which will be attended&nbsp;with good Security; for by reason of the&nbsp;Register settled there by Act of Parliament,&nbsp;I take the Securities of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, to be rather&nbsp;better than those in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">: And this way of&nbsp;Lending Money must likewise be very acceptable to all those whose Estates are under different Incumbrances, which may by this means&nbsp;be reduced into One, and paid off, as they can&nbsp;spare the Money by degrees. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor can I see how any ill Consequences will attend the bringing the Money to <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Par</span><span class="font6"> in&nbsp;both Kingdoms, I know it had none when&nbsp;the Crown-Piece was some Years since reduced&nbsp;from six Shillings to pass at five Shillings and&nbsp;five Pence, and all other Money in Proportion; It neither caused an Alteration in the&nbsp;Rents to the Landlords, nor in the Price of&nbsp;the Product to the Tenants; and I cannot&nbsp;see why the falling it to five Shillings (as it&nbsp;passes here) should carry with it any ill Effect;&nbsp;the Lands of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> would thereby be more&nbsp;worth to the Proprietors, who would then be&nbsp;more willing, and better able, to spend their&nbsp;Money here, when they were freed from such&nbsp;high Exchanges; besides the Advantage to&nbsp;the King in his Revenue. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Commodities we have thence are, Wooll, Hides, Tallow, and Skins, all useful&nbsp;in our Manufactures; as also some Herrings,&nbsp;which we export again; and we ship from&nbsp;thence for other Markets, Beef, Pork, Salmon&nbsp;and Butter; We likewise supply them with&nbsp;Tobacco, Sugar, and other Plantation Goods;&nbsp;also with fine Broad-Cloth, Silk Manufactures,&nbsp;and several other things made here; and with&nbsp;sundry of our Products, as Lead, Tin, Coal,&nbsp;&amp;c. of which last, so great Quantities are&nbsp;carried thither yearly, that it will scarce be&nbsp;credited, how much they say there it amounts&nbsp;unto; besides Muslins, Callicoes, China-Ware,&nbsp;Tea, Coffee, and other <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East-India</span><span class="font6"> Goods:&nbsp;They have indeed, discouraged the Importation of Callicoes, by loading them with a great&nbsp;Duty, but I wonder they do not totally prohibit them, for that single Commodity doth&nbsp;more Injury to their Manufactures, both of&nbsp;Linnen and Woollen, than all the Things they&nbsp;import besides. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I should be very glad to see the Linnen Manufacture there brought to a good Perfection; and I am sure if the Government&nbsp;were at some Charge in doing it, ’twould not&nbsp;be ill laid out. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Canaries.</span>I shall proceed next to the Trade we drive to the Canary Islands<span class="font6">, which brings us nothing&nbsp;but what we consume, and I believe takes&nbsp;from us little of our Product or Manufactures;&nbsp;but since we must drink Wines, ’tis better to&nbsp;have them from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spaniard</span><span class="font6"> than the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6">;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">the first takes off much of our Manufactures, the other little; and I am apt to think,&nbsp;those Wines are paid for out of what we ship&nbsp;to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6">. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Spain.</span>This brings me to the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6"> Trade, which I take to be very profitable to this Kingdom, as it vends much of our Product and&nbsp;Manufactures, and supplies us with many&nbsp;things necessary to be used in making the&nbsp;Latter, and furnishes us with great Quantities&nbsp;of Bullion; I shall divide it into three Parts,&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Biscay</span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Flanders. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">To begin with <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6">, by which I mean, that Part from the Bay of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cadiz</span><span class="font6"> inclusive, East-ward&nbsp;into the Straits of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gibralter</span><span class="font6">, as far as&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catalonia</span><span class="font6">; whither we send all sorts of&nbsp;Woollen Manufactures, Lead, Fish, Tin,&nbsp;Silk and Worsted Stockings, Butter, Tobacco,&nbsp;Ginger, Leather, Bees-Wax, and sundry&nbsp;other things. And in Returns we have&nbsp;thence, some things fit only for&nbsp;Consumption, such as Fruit and Wines, others for our&nbsp;Manufactures, such as Oil, Cochineal, Indigo, Anata, Barillia, and some Salt, with a&nbsp;great Part in Gold and Silver, wherewith&nbsp;they are supplied from their large Empires&nbsp;on the main Land of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6">, whither&nbsp;they export much of the Goods we carry to&nbsp;them. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spaniards</span><span class="font6"> are a stately People, not much given to Trade or Manufactures&nbsp;themselves; therefore the first they carry on by&nbsp;such chargeable and dilatory Methods, both&nbsp;for their Ships and ways of Navigation, that&nbsp;other Trading Nations, such as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">English</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;French</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch</span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Genoese</span><span class="font6">, take Advantage&nbsp;of them; only Their Trade to their</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;West-Indies</span><span class="font6">, hath on strict Penalties been reserved to themselves; but having no Manufactures of their own, the Profit thereof&nbsp;comes very much to be reaped by those who&nbsp;furnish them; Nor is it so well guarded and&nbsp;secured, but that the Inhabitants thereof have&nbsp;been plentifully supplied by us with Manufactures, and many other things from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jamaica</span><span class="font6">, and may be more, by the liberty lately granted to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">South-Sea</span><span class="font6"> Company, whereby we get greater Prices for them, than&nbsp;when they were first Ship’d to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cadiz</span><span class="font6">, and&nbsp;Exported thence thither, which adds to the&nbsp;Wealth of the Nation; This I take to be&nbsp;the true Reason why our Vent for them at&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cadiz</span><span class="font6"> is lessened, because we supply</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;New-Spain</span><span class="font6"> direct with those things they used to&nbsp;have thence before. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">By <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Biscay</span><span class="font6"> I mean all that Part under the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6"> Government which lies in the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bay</span> of&nbsp;that Name, or adjoining to it; The Commodities we send thither are generally the&nbsp;same as we do to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6">, and in Returns we&nbsp;have Wool, Iron, and some Bullion, whereof&nbsp;the first is the best and most Profitable Commodity, which could we secure wholly to our&nbsp;selves, ’twould be of great Advantage to the&nbsp;Nation; but both the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">do come in for their Shares; tho’ I am apt to&nbsp;think the former might be induced to bring&nbsp;it hither by way of Merchandize, if we did&nbsp;so far relax the Act of Navigation, as to give&nbsp;them liberty to do it. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Third part of our <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6"> Trade is That to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Flanders</span><span class="font6">, whereby I mean all those&nbsp;Provinces that were formerly under its Government, but are now under the Emperours,&nbsp;whether we send Commodities much of the&nbsp;same Nature as those we send to the other&nbsp;Parts, tho’ not in so great Quantities, and&nbsp;amongst our Woollen Manufactures more coarse&nbsp;Medleys; also Muscovado Sugars and Coals,&nbsp;but not so much Leather as we have formerly&nbsp;done, being supplied with Raw Hides from&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, which are Tann’d there; We have&nbsp;thence, Linnens, Thread, and other things,&nbsp;which are used both at Home, and also Shipt&nbsp;to our Plantations. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Portugal.</span>The next is the Trade we drive to the Kingdom of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Portugal</span><span class="font6"> and its Islands, where&nbsp;we Vend much of our Product and Manufactures, little different in their kinds from&nbsp;what are sent to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6">; and from thence we&nbsp;have in Returns, Salt, Oil, Woad, Fruit&nbsp;and Wines, besides Gold and Silver; We&nbsp;have, since the War with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font6">, Increased&nbsp;our Importation of their Wines, which is&nbsp;more our Interest to do, than to have them&nbsp;from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font6">, whence our Imports have been&nbsp;always more than our Exports would pay for,&nbsp;and to this Kingdom our Exports are greater&nbsp;than their Products can make us Returns,&nbsp;especially since we have desisted from bringing&nbsp;hither their Sugars and Tobacco, Commodities wherewith we are more Advantageously&nbsp;supplied from our Plantations in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6">, and&nbsp;are now able to furnish Foreign Markets&nbsp;cheaper than they can. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Hamburgh.</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hamburgh </span><span class="font6">is another Market for our Manufactures; This City vends great Quantities of our Cloth, as also Tobacco, Sugars,&nbsp;and other Plantation Commodities, together&nbsp;with several of our Products, which are also&nbsp;thence sent into </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Germany</span><span class="font6">; from whence we&nbsp;have in Returns Linnens, Linnen-yarn, and&nbsp;other Commodities, very necessary both for&nbsp;the Use of our selves and of our Plantations,&nbsp;and little interfering with our own Manufactures. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Poland.</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Poland</span><span class="font6"> also takes off many of our Manufacturers, wherewith it is supplied chiefly from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dantzick</span><span class="font6">, whither they are first carried, and thence disperst into all Parts of&nbsp;that Kingdom, which hath but little Wool of&nbsp;its own, and that chiefly in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ukrania</span><span class="font6">; But the&nbsp;Expence of our Cloth hath been lessened there,&nbsp;since </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Silesia</span><span class="font6">, and the adjoining Parts of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Germany</span><span class="font6">, have turn’d their Looms to that Commodity, occasion’d by our disusing their&nbsp;Linnens, and wearing Callicoes in their Room;&nbsp;we have thence some Linnens, also Potashes. </span></p>

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">From these three last Northern Kingdoms we are furnished with Pitch, Tar, Hemp,&nbsp;Masts, Baulks, and Deal-boards, all very useful&nbsp;to us, and without which we can’t carry&nbsp;on our Navigation, and therefore we must&nbsp;have them, though purchas’d with Money;&nbsp;but the Parliament having encouraged the&nbsp;Importation of some of them from our Plantations on the Continent of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">America</span><span class="font6">, our Dependence on them for those things, will in&nbsp;all probability be lessen’d every Year: I look&nbsp;on any thing that saves our Timber, to be an&nbsp;Advantage to the Nation, which Baulks and&nbsp;Boards do. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">France.</span>The <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> Trade hath every Age grown less profitable to our Woollen Manufacturers,&nbsp;as the Inhabitants make wherewith to supply,&nbsp;both themselves, and other Nations, which&nbsp;they could not do, were they not furnished&nbsp;with Wool from hence and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, their own&nbsp;being unfit to Work by it self: Nor doth&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font6"> spend much of the Growth and Product, either of this Kingdom, or of our&nbsp;Plantations, and furnishes us with nothing to&nbsp;be manufactured here, so that the Trade we&nbsp;drive thither turns only to their Advantage;&nbsp;which being generally for Things consumed&nbsp;among our selves, and our Imports exceeding&nbsp;our Exports, must needs be Loss to the Kingdom; But if the Linnen Manufacture can be&nbsp;settled in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, Paper, Distilling,&nbsp;and Silk Manufactures, encouraged here,&nbsp;the Ballance will soon be altered, especially&nbsp;since the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Portuguese</span><span class="font6"> have made such Improvements in their Wines; only their Salt we shall&nbsp;still want for our Fisheries. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">South Sea.</span>As to the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">South-Sea</span><span class="font6"> Trade, I cannot undertake to say much to it, being but lately enter’d upon, and limitted by Act of Parliament to an exclusive Company, according to&nbsp;whose Management it may prove more or less&nbsp;Advantagious to the Nation; only in this I&nbsp;believe we may be certain, That they will&nbsp;never carry away our Bullion, as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East-India&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">Company does, but in all Probability will&nbsp;bring us more. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">What Foreign Trades are profitable to our Manufactures, and what are not.</span>And thus I have run through the Foreign Trades driven from this Kingdom, and shew’d&nbsp;how they advance its Interest, by taking off&nbsp;our Product and Manufactures, and supplying us with Materials to be manufactured&nbsp;again; wherein ’tis a certain Rule, that so far&nbsp;as any Nation furnishes us with things already&nbsp;manufactured, or only to be spent amongst&nbsp;our selves, so much less is our Advantage by&nbsp;the Trade we drive with them; especially if&nbsp;those Manufactures interfere with our own,&nbsp;and are purchased with Bullion. Therefore I&nbsp;think the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">East-India</span><span class="font6"> Trade to be unprofitable&nbsp;to us, hindering by its Silks, Muslins, and&nbsp;Callicoes, the Consumption of more of&nbsp;our Manufactures in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font6">, than it doth take&nbsp;from us.

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Difference in Employing our own Ships and those of other Nations.</span>And this is farther to be noted in our Trade with Foreign Nations, that where&nbsp;they fetch from us our Product and Manufactures, and make their Imports to us, in&nbsp;their own Ships, we get less by the Trade we&nbsp;drive with them, than if we did it in ours,&nbsp;because That doth also Encourage our Navigation; and Freights are a great and profitable Article in Trade; Therefore we get more&nbsp;by the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish</span><span class="font6"> Trade, because we generally&nbsp;drive it in our own Bottoms; and we lose&nbsp;more by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> Trade when they bring us&nbsp;their Wines and Brandy, than when we fetch&nbsp;them ourselves; and accordingly we may take&nbsp;our Measures in judging of all other Trades. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Whether a true Judgment may be made of the Ballance of Foreign Trade.</span>It hath been a great Debate how the Ballance of our Foreign Trade shall be computed, and what Methods we should take whereby to know it, and it has been thought,&nbsp;that the most proper way to make a true&nbsp;Judgment therein is, by taking an Account&nbsp;from the Custom-House Books of our Exports&nbsp;and Imports; But if this Method would do,&nbsp;yet I do not think there can be any certainty,&nbsp;either of the one or the other, drawn from&nbsp;thence; for, as for our Imports, the Bullion, and such things of Value, are not entered&nbsp;there, and seldom presented; and as to the&nbsp;Exports, seeing our Woollen Manufactures&nbsp;go out Custom-Free, the Entries there made&nbsp;of them cannot be depended on; But suppose&nbsp;a more exact account of our Exports and Imports could be had, yet since so great a part&nbsp;of the Trade of this Kingdom is driven by&nbsp;Exchange, and such vast Quantities of Commodities are Imported from our Plantations&nbsp;for account of the Inhabitants there, the Produce whereof they leave here as a stock at&nbsp;Home, and that they are supply’d hence with&nbsp;so many things for their own Consumption,&nbsp;I cannot see how any Moderate Computation&nbsp;can be this way made of our general Trade,&nbsp;much less of that we drive with any particular&nbsp;Nation, the Commodities which we receive at one place, being often carried to an another; Thus we transport to <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Italy</span><span class="font6"> the Sugars we&nbsp;receive for our Manufactures in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Portugal</span><span class="font6">, and&nbsp;bring thence Silk and other things to be&nbsp;manufactured here, and yet we must not conclude we lose by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Portugal</span><span class="font6"> Trade, because&nbsp;the Returns thence fall short by the Custom-House&nbsp;Books, or that we get more by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Italian</span><span class="font6"> Trade, because it doth not appear by&nbsp;those Books how we Exported Commodities&nbsp;to pay for what we Import thence; And as to&nbsp;the Profits we make by the Freights of our&nbsp;Ships, it doth not at all appear from them,&nbsp;nor at what Rates our Product and Manufactures are sold abroad, or our Plantation&nbsp;Goods to Foreigners at home; so the thing&nbsp;must still remain doubtful; and I know no&nbsp;more certain way to Judge of it, than by the&nbsp;Increase the Nation makes in its Bullion,&nbsp;which always arises from the over Ballance of&nbsp;our Foreign Barter and Commerce. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Committee of Trade.</span>And for the better Encouraging the Trade of this Kingdom, I think it well worthy the&nbsp;Thoughts of a Parliament, whether a standing&nbsp;Committee, made up of Men well verst therein, should not be appointed; whose sole&nbsp;Business it should be to consider the state thereof, and to find out Ways to Improve it; to&nbsp;see how the Trades we drive with Foreign&nbsp;Kingdoms, grow more or less profitable to us;&nbsp;How and by what Means we are out done&nbsp;by others in the Trades we drive, or hindered from Emlarging them; what is necessary to&nbsp;be prohibited, both in our Exports and Imports, and for how long time; to hear Complaints from our Factories abroad, and to&nbsp;Correspond with our Ministers there, in&nbsp;affairs relating to our Trade, and to represent&nbsp;all things rightly to the Government, with&nbsp;their Advice, what Courses are proper to be&nbsp;taken for its Encouragement; and generally&nbsp;to study by what means and Methods the&nbsp;Trade of this Kingdom may be Improved,&nbsp;both abroad and at home. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">If this was well settled, the good Effects thereof would soon be seen; But then great&nbsp;Care must be taken, that these Places be not&nbsp;fill’d up with such who know nothing of the&nbsp;Business, and thereby this Excellent Constitution&nbsp;become only a Matter of Form and Expence. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">In the Management of things of much less moment, we employ such who are&nbsp;supposed to understand what they undertake, and&nbsp;believe they cannot be carryed on without&nbsp;them; Whilst the general Trade of the Nation (which is the support of all) lies neglected, as if the Coggs that direct its Wheels did&nbsp;not need skill to keep them true; Trade requires as much Policy as matters of State,&nbsp;and can never be kept in a regular Motion&nbsp;by Accident; when the Frame of our Trade&nbsp;is out of Order, we know not where to begin to mend it, for want of a set of Experienced Builders, ready to receive Applications, and able to judge where the Defect&nbsp;lies. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Such a Committee as this will soon appear to be of great Use and Service, both&nbsp;to the Parliament in Framing Laws relating&nbsp;to Trade, and also to the Government in&nbsp;the Treaties they make with Foreign Nations. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As to the First, It hath sometimes been thought, that when That Great and Glorious&nbsp;Assembly hath medled with Trade, they&nbsp;have left it worse than they found it; And the&nbsp;Reason is, because the Laws relating to Trade,&nbsp;require more time to look into their distant&nbsp;Consequences, than a Session will admit;&nbsp;whereof we have had many Instances. </p>

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">In the 14th <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Car.</span><span class="font6"> II.

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">By a Statute 4th and 5th <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W.</span><span class="font6"> </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">M.</span><span class="font6"> Twenty Shillings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Tun was laid on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lapis&nbsp;Caliminaris</span><span class="font6"> Dug here and Exported, on an&nbsp;Information given to the House of Commons, that it was not to be had any where else; the&nbsp;Merchants concerned in Exporting that Commodity made Application, and set forth, that&nbsp;such a Duty would bring in Nothing to the&nbsp;Crown, but be a total Bar to its Exportation;&nbsp;yet the Act past, and we were like to have&nbsp;made a fatal Experiment, for till the Statute&nbsp;of the 7th and 8th of the same King, which&nbsp;reduced the Duty to Two Shillings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Tun,&nbsp;the Exportation ceased; and in the mean&nbsp;time, those Places, which had been discouraged&nbsp;from Digging and Calcining it, because we&nbsp;undersold them, set again to Work, and supplied&nbsp;the Markets where we Vended ours. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">What Injury was done by the Act made in the 9th and 10th <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W.</span><span class="font6"> IIId. for the more&nbsp;effectual Preventing the Importation of Foreign Bonelace, &amp;c. doth sufficiently appear&nbsp;by the Preamble of That made in the 11th</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">and 12th of the same Reign for repealing it&nbsp;Three Months after the Prohibition of our&nbsp;Wollen Manufactures in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Flanders</span><span class="font6"> (which was&nbsp;occasioned by it) should be there taken off;&nbsp;but I don’t understand that is yet done, and&nbsp;it may prove an irrecoverable Loss to the Nation. </span></p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I <span class="font6">mention these things with great Submission to the Judgment of that Glorious Assembly, the Wisdom and Strength of the Nation; to whom I only presume with all Humility to offer my Thoughts, that it would&nbsp;very much tend to the putting Matters of&nbsp;Trade into a True Light before them, if they&nbsp;were first referred to a Body of Men, well&nbsp;verst in the true Principles thereof, and able&nbsp;to see through the Sophistical Arguments of&nbsp;contending Parties, to be by them considered,&nbsp;and well digested, before they received the&nbsp;Sanction of a Law. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And as to Foreign Treaties; I do not think our Trade hath been so much bettered&nbsp;by them as it might have been, for want of&nbsp;such a Committee; the Representations made&nbsp;by Private Merchants, (who generally differ&nbsp;according as their Interests clash with each&nbsp;other) tending rather to distract, than to inform the Government; which would not be,&nbsp;if their first Applications were made to an&nbsp;Experienc’d Committee, who had Judgment&nbsp;enough to subtract out of them what was&nbsp;proper to be offer’d; By which means, our Demands might be rendred short and comprehensive. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We have Natural Advantages in Trade above other Nations, besides the Benefit of&nbsp;our Scituation, the Foundation of our Woollen&nbsp;Manufactures being as it were peculiar to our&nbsp;own Growth, and may be retained amongst&nbsp;our selves; An Advantage the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> have not,&nbsp;whose Wealth arising chiefly from the Exportation of their Wines, Brandy, Salt, Paper,&nbsp;Silks, and Linnens, both we and other Nations, have made such a Progress in them all&nbsp;since the War began, as to render theirs less&nbsp;sought for; whereas, nothing but our own&nbsp;Neglects, and ill Managements, can let our&nbsp;Neighbours into our Manufactures, which we&nbsp;may soon put a stop to, by securing our Wool&nbsp;at Home. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Insurance.</span>I cannot close this Discourse, without speaking something of Insurance; The first Design&nbsp;whereof was to encourage the Merchants to&nbsp;Export more of our Product and Manufactures,&nbsp;when they knew how to ease themselves in&nbsp;their Adventures, and to bear only such a Proportion thereof as they were willing and able&nbsp;to do; but by the Irregular Practices of some&nbsp;Men, this first Intention is wholly obviated;&nbsp;who without any Interest, have put in early&nbsp;Policies, and gotten large Subscriptions on&nbsp;Ships, only to make Advantage by Selling&nbsp;them to Others; and therefore have Industriously&nbsp;promoted False Reports, and spread&nbsp;Rumours, to the Prejudice of the Ships and&nbsp;Masters, filling Mens Minds with Doubts,&nbsp;whereby the fair Trading Merchant, when he&nbsp;comes to Insure his Interest, either can get no&nbsp;one to Underwrite, or at such high Rates, that&nbsp;he finds it better to Buy the Others Policies at&nbsp;Advance; by this means these Stock-Jobbers&nbsp;of Insurance have as it were turn’d it into&nbsp;a Wager, to the great Prejudice of Trade;&nbsp;Likewise many ill designing Men, their Policies&nbsp;being over-valued, have (to the Abhorence of&nbsp;Honest Traders, and to the Scandal of Trade&nbsp;it self) contriv’d the Loss of their own Ships;&nbsp;On the other side, the Underwriters, when&nbsp;a Loss is ever so fairly proved, boggle in&nbsp;their Payments, and force the Insured to be&nbsp;content with less than their Agreements, for&nbsp;fear of engaging themselves in long and&nbsp;chargeable Suits. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Now if the Parliament would please to take these things into their Consideration,&nbsp;they may reduce Insurance to its first Intention, by obliging the Insured to bear such a&nbsp;Proportionable part of his Adventure (the&nbsp;Premio included) as to them shall seem fit,&nbsp;and also the Insurers, when a loss is fully&nbsp;made out, to pay their Subscriptions without&nbsp;Abatement, which will prevent both; and&nbsp;if any Differences should arise, to direct easy&nbsp;ways for adjusting them, without attending&nbsp;long Issues at Law, or being bound up to&nbsp;such nice Rules in their Proofs, as the Affairs&nbsp;of Foreign Trade will not admit. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Wilful casting away Ships by the Owners.</span>I know, that by a Clause in a Statute made <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">primo Annæ</span><span class="font6">, the wilful Casting away, Burning,&nbsp;or otherwise destroying a Ship, by any Captain, Master, Mariner, or other Officer belonging to it, is made Felony, without Benefit of Clergy; But that Statute is so qualify’d,&nbsp;that it is difficult to Convict the Offender, because the Fact must be done, to the Prejudice&nbsp;of the Owner or Owners, or of any Merchant or Merchants that shall load Goods&nbsp;thereon, else he doth not come within its&nbsp;Penalty, so it doth not reach the Evil I here&nbsp;mention, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> the Abominable Contrivance of&nbsp;the Owners to have their own Ships&nbsp;destroyed, in order to make an Advantage by their&nbsp;Insurances; (a Crime so black in it self, that&nbsp;it cannot be mentioned without Horror).&nbsp;These Men, when they frame their dark Designs, will take care, for the Security of those&nbsp;they employ, that none besides themselves&nbsp;shall load Goods on the Ships they intend&nbsp;shall be thus destroyed, and it cannot be&nbsp;supposed that they receive Prejudice thereby&nbsp;themselves, so the Prosecution on that Statute&nbsp;is evaded; But if the Insured were bound to&nbsp;make out their Interests, and to bear a Proportionable part of the Loss themselves, this&nbsp;would as it were Naturally prevent such&nbsp;Scandalous Practices. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Whether the Price of Labour is a Hindrance to Improvements in our Products and Manufactures.</span>Before I enter on the Business of the Poor, I will consider of a Question that hath&nbsp;arisen, and I have heard sometimes debated&nbsp;by Men of good Understanding, which is,&nbsp;Whether the Labour of the Poor being so&nbsp;high, does not hinder Improvements in our&nbsp;Product and Manufactures; Which having&nbsp;some Relation to the Subject Matter of this&nbsp;Discourse, I shall offer my Thoughts thereon,&nbsp;with Submission to better Judgments, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">That both our Product and Manufactures&nbsp;may be carry’d on to Advantage, without&nbsp;running down the Labour of the Poor. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As to the first, our Product, I am of opinion, that the running down the Labour of the Poor is no advantage to it, nor is it the&nbsp;Interest of that part of the Kingdom called&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> to do it, nor can the People thereof&nbsp;live on so low Wages as they do in other&nbsp;Countries; for we must consider, that Wages&nbsp;must bear a Rate in all Nations according to&nbsp;the Price of Provisions; where Wheat is sold&nbsp;for One Shilling </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Bushel, and all things&nbsp;suitable, a labouring Man may afford to work&nbsp;for Three Pence a day, as well as he can for&nbsp;Twelve Pence, where it is sold for Four Shillings; and this Price of Wheat arises chiefly&nbsp;from the Value of Land; For it cannot&nbsp;be imagined, that the Farmer who gives&nbsp;Twenty Shillings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Acre, can afford it as low&nbsp;as he whose Lands cost him but Five Shillings&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Acre, and produces the same Crop, nor&nbsp;can Labour be expected to be so low in such&nbsp;a Country, as in the other; This is the Case of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">, whose Lands yielding great Rents,&nbsp;require good Prices for the Product; and&nbsp;this is the Freeholders Advantage; for&nbsp;supposing Necessaries to be the Current Payment&nbsp;for Labour, in such cases, whether we call&nbsp;a Bushel of Wheat One Shilling, or Four&nbsp;Shillings, it will be all one to him, for so&nbsp;much as he pays, but not for the Overplus of&nbsp;his Crop, which makes a great Difference into his Pocket; you cannot fall Wages, unless&nbsp;you fall Product; and if you fall Product,&nbsp;you must necessarily fall Lands. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And as for the Second, our Manufactures, I am of Opinion, that they may be carryed on to&nbsp;Advantage, without running down the Labour of the Poor; for which I offer </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1. Observation, or Experience of what&nbsp;hath been done; we have and daily do see&nbsp;that it is so; the Refiners of Sugars sell for&nbsp;Six Pence <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Pound, what yielded formerly&nbsp;Twelve Pence; the Distillers sell their Spirits&nbsp;for one half of what they formerly did; Glass&nbsp;Bottles, Silk-Stockins, and other Manufactures (too many to be here enumerated) are&nbsp;sold for not much more than half the Price&nbsp;they were some years since, without falling the Labour of the Poor. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But then the Question will be, how this is done? Truly it proceeds from the Ingenuity of the Manufacturer, and the Improvements he attains to in the ways of his&nbsp;Working; Thus the Refiners of Sugars go&nbsp;through that Operation by easier Methods, and&nbsp;in less time, than their Predecessors did;&nbsp;Thus the Distillers draw more Spirits from&nbsp;the things they work on, than those formerly did who taught them the Art; The Glass-Maker&nbsp;hath found a Quicker way of making&nbsp;it out of things which cost him little; Silk-Stockings are Wove; Tobacco is cut by Engines; Books are Printed; Deal-Boards are&nbsp;Sawn with Mills; Lead is Smelted by&nbsp;Wind-Furnaces; all which save the Labour of&nbsp;many Hands, so the Wages of those employed need not be fallen. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Besides which, there is a Cunning crept into Trades; The Clock-maker hath improved his Art to such a degree, that Labour and Materials are the least Part the&nbsp;Buyer pays for; The variety of our Woollen&nbsp;Manufactures is so pretty, that Fashion makes&nbsp;a thing worth twice the Price it is sold for&nbsp;after, the Humour of the Buyer carrying a&nbsp;great Sway in its Value; Artificers, by Tools&nbsp;and Laves, fitted for different Uses, make&nbsp;such things, as would puzzle a stander by to&nbsp;set a Price on, according to the worth of&nbsp;Mens Labour; the Plummer by new Inventions casts a Tun of shot for Ten Shillings,&nbsp;which might seem to deserve Forty. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The same Art is crept into Navigation; Freights are much fallen from what they&nbsp;formerly were at, and yet Sailor’s Wages are still&nbsp;the same; Ships are built more for Stowage,&nbsp;and made strong enough to be loaden between&nbsp;Decks, and Voyages are performed in less&nbsp;time; Wool is Steved into them by such&nbsp;proper Instruments, that three or four Baggs&nbsp;are put, where one would not else lye;&nbsp;Cranes and Blocks help to draw up more for&nbsp;one Shilling, then Mens Labour without&nbsp;them would do for Five. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">New Projections are every day set on Foot to render the making our Woollen Manufactures easy, which should be render’d cheaper by the Contrivance of the Manufacturers,&nbsp;not by falling the Price of Labour; Cheapness&nbsp;creates Expence, and Expence gives fresh Employments, whereby the Poor will be still kept&nbsp;at Work. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The same for our Product; Mines and Pitts are drained by Engines and Aquæducts&nbsp;instead of Hands; the Husband-Man turns&nbsp;up the Ground with his Sullow, not Diggs it&nbsp;with his Spade; covers his Grain with the&nbsp;Harrow, not with the Rake; brings home&nbsp;his Harvest with Carts, not on Mens Backs;&nbsp;and many other easy Methods are used, both&nbsp;for Improving of Land, and raising its Product, which lessen the number of Labourers,&nbsp;and make room for better Wages to be given those that are Imployed. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor am I of their Opinion, who think the running down the Price of our Growth&nbsp;and Product, that so they may buy Provisions&nbsp;cheap, an Advantage to the Inland&nbsp;Trade of this Kingdom, but of the contrary. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">To understand this rightly, let us begin with the Shop-keeper, or Buyer and Seller,&nbsp;who is the Wheel whereon the Inland Trade&nbsp;turns, as he buys of the Importer and Manufacturer, and sells again to the Country;&nbsp;suppose this Man spends Two Hundred Pounds&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Annum in all things necessary for&nbsp;himself and Family, as Provisions, Cloaths,&nbsp;House-Rent, and other Expences, the&nbsp;Question will be, what part of this is laid out&nbsp;in Flesh, Corn, Butter, Cheese, &amp;c. barely&nbsp;considered according to their first Cost in the&nbsp;Market? I presume Fifty or Sixty Pounds </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Annum to be the most, whereon the Advance&nbsp;to him will not be so much by keeping up&nbsp;our Product to a good Rate, as the Profits&nbsp;which will consequently arise in his Trade will&nbsp;amount unto; For by this means the Farmer&nbsp;will be enabled to give a better Rent to his&nbsp;Landlord, who may then keep a more Plentiful Table, spend more Wine, Fruit, Sugars,&nbsp;Spices, and other things wherewith he is&nbsp;furnished from the City, suit himself and his&nbsp;Family oftner, and carry on a greater Splendour&nbsp;in every thing; the Farmer according to&nbsp;his condition may do the same, and give&nbsp;higher Wages to the Labourers imployed in&nbsp;Husbandry, who may then live better, and&nbsp;buy new Cloaths oftner, instead of patching&nbsp;up old ones; by this means the Manufacturers&nbsp;will be encouraged to give a better Price for&nbsp;Wooll and Labour, when they shall find a&nbsp;Vent as fast as they can make; and a Flux of&nbsp;Wealth causing a Variety of Fashions, will&nbsp;add Wings to their Inventions, when they&nbsp;shall see their Manufactures advanced in their&nbsp;Values by the Buyer’s Fancy; This likewise&nbsp;will encourage the Merchants to encrease their&nbsp;Exports, when they shall find a quick Vent&nbsp;for their Imports; By which regular Circulation, Payments will be short, and all will&nbsp;grow rich; But when Trade deadens in the&nbsp;Fountain, when the Gentlemen and the Farmers are kept low, every one in his order feels&nbsp;it, It being most certain, and grounded on&nbsp;the Observation of all Men who have lookt&nbsp;into it, That in those Countrys where Provisions are Cheap, the People are generally&nbsp;Poor, both proceeding from the want of&nbsp;Trade; so that he who will give a right&nbsp;Judgment in this Matter, must not consider&nbsp;things only as they offer themselves at the&nbsp;first Sight, but as they will be in their&nbsp;Consequences. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As to the other part of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Great Britain</span><span class="font6"> called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland</span><span class="font6">, I can say little with Relation to this Matter, my Knowledge of that part of&nbsp;the Kingdom being not sufficient to enable me&nbsp;to do it: But I am apt to believe, that the&nbsp;same General Maxim must hold good there&nbsp;also, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> That the Rates of Labour must be&nbsp;according to the Prices of Provisions, and&nbsp;those according to the Rents of the Lands. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">The Poor.</span>Having thus gone through the State of<sup> </sup>the Nation with respect to its Trade, I will&nbsp;next consider it with respect to the Poor. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And here it cannot but seem strange, that this Kingdom, which so much abounds in&nbsp;Product and Manufactures, besides the Imployment&nbsp;given in Navigation, should want work&nbsp;for any of its People; the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dutch</span><span class="font6">, who have&nbsp;little of the two former, if compared with&nbsp;us, and do not exceed us in the latter, suffer&nbsp;no Beggars; whereas we, whose Wealth consists&nbsp;in the Labour of our Inhabitants, seem&nbsp;to encourage them in an Idle way of Living,&nbsp;contrary to their own and the Nations&nbsp;Interest. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Curse under which Man first fell was Labour; That by the Sweat of his Brows he&nbsp;should eat his Bread; This is a state of&nbsp;Happiness, if compared to that which attends&nbsp;Idleness: He that walks the Streets of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">and observes the Fatigues used by </span>the Beggars to&nbsp;make themselves seem Objects of Charity,&nbsp;must conclude, that they take more Pains&nbsp;than an Honest Man doth at his Trade, and&nbsp;yet seem not to get Bread to eat: Beggary&nbsp;is now become an Art or Mystery, to which&nbsp;Children are brought up from their Cradles;&nbsp;any thing that may move Compassion is made&nbsp;a Livelyhood, a Sore Leg or Arm, or for&nbsp;want thereof a Pretended one; the Tricks&nbsp;and Devices I have observed to be used by&nbsp;these People, have often made me think,&nbsp;that those Parts, if better employed, might&nbsp;be made useful to the Nation. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Here I will consider, </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1. What hath been the Cause of this Mischief&nbsp;of Idleness, and how it hath crept in&nbsp;upon us. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2. What must be done to restrain its going farther. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">3. What Methods are proper to be used, in order to make a Provision for those who&nbsp;are past their Labour. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As to the First; we shall find that it hath proceeded, partly from the Abuse of those&nbsp;Laws we have, and partly from want of&nbsp;better; Licences for Ale-houses were at first&nbsp;granted for good Ends, not to draw Men aside&nbsp;from their Labour by Games and Sports, but&nbsp;to support and refresh them under it; and as&nbsp;they were then a Maintainance to the Aged,&nbsp;so Poor Families had Opportunities of being&nbsp;supplied with a Cup of Ale from Abroad,&nbsp;who could not keep it at Home; great&nbsp;Observation was also made to prevent Idle Tipling, our Fore-Fathers considered, that time&nbsp;so spent was a Loss to the Nation, whose&nbsp;Interest was improved by the Labour of its&nbsp;Inhabitants; Whereas Ale-houses are now encouraged, to promote the Income of Excise,&nbsp;on whom there must be no Restraint, lest the&nbsp;King’s Revenue should be lessened; Thus we live by Sense, and look only at things we&nbsp;see, without revolving on what the Issue will&nbsp;be, not considering, that the Labour of each&nbsp;Man, if well employ’d, whilst he sits in an&nbsp;Ale-house, would be worth much more to the&nbsp;Nation, than the Excise he pays. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But above all, our Laws to set the Poor at Work are short and Defective, tending&nbsp;rather to Maintain them so, then to raise them&nbsp;to a better way of Living; ’Tis true, those&nbsp;Laws design well, but consisting only in Generals, and not reducing things to Practicable&nbsp;Methods, they fall short of answering their&nbsp;Ends, and thereby render the Poor more bold,&nbsp;when they know the Parish Officers are bound,&nbsp;either to provide them Work, or to give them&nbsp;Maintenance. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Now, if we delighted more in the Encouraging our Manufactures, our Poor might be better Employed, and then ’twould be a&nbsp;shame, for any Person capable of Labour, to&nbsp;live Idle; which leads me to the Second&nbsp;Consideration, What must be done to restrain&nbsp;this Habit of Idleness from going farther. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Here I find, that nothing but good Laws can do it, such as may provide Work for&nbsp;those who are willing, and force them to Work&nbsp;that are able; And for this use I think Work-houses&nbsp;very expedient, but they must be&nbsp;Founded on such Principles, as may employ the&nbsp;Poor, for which they must be fitted, and the&nbsp;Poor for them; wherein Employments must&nbsp;be provided for all sorts of People, who must&nbsp;also be compelled to go thither when sent,&nbsp;and the Work-houses to receive them; and&nbsp;the Materials which seem most proper for&nbsp;them are Simples, such as Wooll, Hemp,&nbsp;Cotton, and the like, which may either be&nbsp;sent in by the Manufacturers, or be bought&nbsp;up on a Stock raised for that End; These will&nbsp;employ great Numbers, of both Sexes, and&nbsp;all Ages, either by Beating and Fitting the&nbsp;Hemp, or by Dressing and Spinning the Flax,&nbsp;or by Carding and Spinning the Wool and&nbsp;Cotton, of Different Finenesses; and if a Reward was given to that Person who should&nbsp;spin the Finest Thread of either, as they do&nbsp;in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> for their Linnen, to be adjudged&nbsp;Yearly, and paid by the County, or by any&nbsp;other manner as shall be thought fit, ’twould&nbsp;very much promote Industry and Ingenuity,&nbsp;whilst every one being stir’d up by Ambition,&nbsp;and Hopes of Profit, would endeavour to exceed the rest; by which means we should also&nbsp;grow more excellent in our Manufactures. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor should these Houses hinder any who desire to Work at Home, or the Manufacturers from Employing them, the Design being to Provide places for those who care not&nbsp;to Work any where, and to make the Parish&nbsp;Officers more Industrious to find them out,&nbsp;when they know whither to send them, by&nbsp;which means they would be better able to&nbsp;maintain the Impotent. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">It seems also convenient, that these Work-houses, when setled in Cities and great Towns,&nbsp;should not be only Parochial, but one or more&nbsp;in each Place, as will best suit it; which would&nbsp;prevent the Poors being sent from Parish to&nbsp;Parish, and Provided for no where; and when&nbsp;once the Poor shall come by use to be in love&nbsp;with Labour, ’twill be strange to see an Idle&nbsp;Person; Then they will be so far from being a&nbsp;Burthen to the Nation, that they will become&nbsp;its Wealth, and their own Lives also will be&nbsp;more comfortable to them. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">There are other things which will employ the Poor besides our Manufactures, and are also equally Beneficial to the Nation; such&nbsp;as Navigation, Husbandry, and Handicrafts; here if these or such like Rules were observed,&nbsp;they might be made more advantageous to&nbsp;all. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">As First, Let the Justices of the Peace have Power to assign Youth to Artificers, Husbandry,&nbsp;Manufacturers, and Mariners, and to&nbsp;bind them Apprentices for a Time certain,&nbsp;at such Ages as they shall think ’em fit to go&nbsp;on those Employments, who should also be&nbsp;obliged to receive them; and tho’ this&nbsp;may at first seem hard, as hindring the Masters from taking Servants who may bring them&nbsp;Money, yet after some time it will not, when&nbsp;those who were so bound out themselves, shall&nbsp;only do for others what was done for them&nbsp;before; and this also may be now made good&nbsp;to them, by such an Overplus of years in&nbsp;their Apprentiships, as may be an Equivalent&nbsp;to the Money. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And as for those of elder years, who will rather Beg than Work, let them be forced to&nbsp;serve the King in his Fleet, or the Merchants&nbsp;on board their Ships; the Sea is very good&nbsp;to cure sore Leggs and Arms, especially such&nbsp;as are Counterfeits, against which, the&nbsp;Capstern, with the Taunts of the Sailors, is a&nbsp;certain Remedy. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Next, for Ale-houses, Coffee-houses, and such like Employments, let them be kept&nbsp;only by Aged People, or such who have numerous Families. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Let Masters of Ships be obliged to carry with them some Landmen every Voyage,&nbsp;which will increase our Seamen, and let the&nbsp;Justices have Power to force them to receive&nbsp;such as are willing to enter themselves, and to&nbsp;settle the Rates of their Wages. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Let Young People be prohibited from Hawking about the streets, and from Singing&nbsp;Ballads; if these things be allowed, they are&nbsp;fitter for Age. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Stage-Plays, Lotteries, and Gaming-houses should be strictly looked after, Youth,&nbsp;in this Age of Idleness and Luxury, being&nbsp;not only drawn aside by them, but also more&nbsp;willing to put themselves on such easy ways&nbsp;of living, than on Labour. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These and such like Methods, being Improved by the Wisdom of a Parliament, may tend, not only to the Introducing a Habit of&nbsp;Virtue amongst us, but also to the making&nbsp;Multitudes of People serviceable, who are&nbsp;now useless to the Nation; there being scarce&nbsp;any one, who is not capable of doing something towards his Maintenance, and what his&nbsp;Labour doth fall short, must be made up by&nbsp;Charity; but as things now are, no Man&nbsp;knows where ’tis rightly plac’d, by which&nbsp;means those who are truly Objects do not&nbsp;partake thereof; And let it be consider’d, that if&nbsp;every Person did by his Labour add one Half-penny&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per diem</span><span class="font6"> to the Publick, ’twould bring&nbsp;in Seven Millions six Hundred and Four Thousand&nbsp;one Hundred Sixty six Pounds thirteen&nbsp;Shillings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Annum</span><span class="font6">, (accounting ten Millions&nbsp;of People to be in the Kingdom) so vast a&nbsp;Sum may be raised from a Multitude, if every&nbsp;one adds a little. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor is the sending lazy People to our Plantations abroad (who can neither by good&nbsp;Laws be forced, or by Rewards be encourag’d to work at home) so prejudicial to the&nbsp;Nation as some do imagine, where they must&nbsp;expect another sort of Treatment, if they&nbsp;will not labour; ’tis true, they give no help&nbsp;in the Manufactures here, but That is made&nbsp;up in the Product they raise there, which is&nbsp;also Profit to the Nation; Besides, the Humours and other Circumstances of People are&nbsp;to be enquired into, some have been very useful&nbsp;there, who would never have been so here: And if the People of this Kingdom be&nbsp;employ’d to the Advantage of the Community,&nbsp;no Matter in what part of the King’s Dominions it is; many hundreds by going to&nbsp;those Plantations, have become profitable&nbsp;Members to the Common-wealth, who had&nbsp;they continued here, had still remain’d Idle&nbsp;Drones; now they raise Sugar, Cotton, Tobacco, and other things, which employ&nbsp;Sailors abroad, and Manufacturers at home,&nbsp;all which being the Product of Earth and&nbsp;Labour, I take to be the Wealth of the Nation. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Employment of Watermen on the River <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thames</span><span class="font6"> breeds many Sailors, and it were&nbsp;good to keep them still fill’d with Apprentices; also the Employment of Bargemen,&nbsp;Lightermen, and Trowmen, both on That and&nbsp;other Rivers, does the same, who should be&nbsp;encouraged to breed up Landmen, and fit&nbsp;them for the Sea. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Idleness is the Foundation of all those Vices which prevail among us, People, aiming&nbsp;to be maintained any way rather than by Labour, betake themselves to all sorts of Villanies;&nbsp;the ill Consequences whereof cannot be prevented, but by encouraging Youth in an early&nbsp;delight of Living by Industry, and on what&nbsp;they call their Own, rather than by Dependance on others, which will keep up a true&nbsp;British Spirit, and put them on Honest Endeavours, and this will get them Credit and&nbsp;Reputation, and give them Opportunities of&nbsp;advancing their Fortunes; and if such an&nbsp;Emulation went through the Kingdom, we&nbsp;should not have so many Lazy Beggars, or&nbsp;Licentious Livers, as now there are; Nor is&nbsp;GOD more honour’d among any, than He is&nbsp;among such Industrious People, who abhor&nbsp;Vice, on equal Principles of Religion and&nbsp;good Husbandry, Labour being usually a&nbsp;Barrier against Sin, which doth generally enter&nbsp;at the Doors of Idleness. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Third Consideration is, What Methods must be used to provide for those, who either&nbsp;are not able to work, or whose Labour can’t&nbsp;support their Charge; Here I take&nbsp;Alms-houses to be good Gifts, where they are&nbsp;designed to relieve Old Age, or Educate Youth;&nbsp;not to maintain idle Beggars, or ease Rich&nbsp;Parishes, but to provide for those who have&nbsp;been bred up in Careful Employments, tho’&nbsp;not able to stem the Current of Cross Fortunes:&nbsp;Two such have been sumptuously Founded,<span class="sni">Mr. Edward Colson’s Two Almshouses in Bristol.</span> and suitably Endowed, in the City of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bristol</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;Edward Colson</span><span class="font6">, Esq; a Merchant and Native&nbsp;thereof, who is still living; one of them for&nbsp;Twenty Four Men and Women, who had formerly lived well; the Other for One hundred&nbsp;Boys, to be Educated in the Principles of&nbsp;Vertue, and afterwards set out to Trades,&nbsp;whereby they may get their Livelihoods; a&nbsp;Charity so great in it self, and carried on so&nbsp;free from Ostentation, that the like is not to&nbsp;be seen in any Part of this Kingdom, of the&nbsp;Free Gift of One Gentleman in his Life-time;&nbsp;which he hath settled in the Society of Merchants Adventurers within That City, of whose&nbsp;Care and Fidelity in the well Management&nbsp;thereof, he is fully Satisfied. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Another way to provide for those who are true Objects of Charity is, by taking&nbsp;Care that the Poors Rates be made with more&nbsp;equality in Cities and great Towns, especially&nbsp;in the former; where the greatest Number of&nbsp;Poor usually residing together in the Suburbs&nbsp;or Out-Parishes, are very Serviceable by their&nbsp;Labours to the Rich, in carrying on their&nbsp;Trades; yet when Age, Sickness, or a Numerous Family, make them desire Relief, their chief Dependance must be on People&nbsp;but one step above their own Conditions; by&nbsp;which means these Out-Parishes are more&nbsp;burthened in their Payments, than the&nbsp;In-Parishes are, tho’ much Richer, and is one&nbsp;Reason why they are so ill Inhabited, no&nbsp;Man careing to come to a certain Charge:&nbsp;And this is attended with another ill Consequence, the want of better Inhabitants&nbsp;making way for those Disorders which easily&nbsp;grow among the Poor; whereas, if Cities and&nbsp;Towns were made but one Poors Rate, or&nbsp;equally divided into more, these&nbsp;Inconveniencies would be removed, and the Poor&nbsp;be maintained by a more equal Contribution. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And that a better Provision may be made for the Relief of Sailors (who having spent&nbsp;their Labours in the Service of the Nation,&nbsp;and through Age and Disasters are no longer&nbsp;fit for the Fatigues of the Sea, ought to be&nbsp;taken Care of at Home) let a small Deduction&nbsp;be made from the Freights of Ships, and from&nbsp;Seamens Wages, to be Collected by a Society&nbsp;of honest Men in every Sea-Port; This, with&nbsp;what Additions might be made by the Gifts&nbsp;of Worthy Benefactors, would be sufficient&nbsp;to Raise a Fund, to maintain them in their&nbsp;Old-Age, who in their Youths were our Walls&nbsp;and Bulwarks; But it must be settled by Law,&nbsp;and no Man left at his Liberty whether he&nbsp;will pay or no; These are generally the most&nbsp;Laborious People that we have; I do not mean&nbsp;those scoundrel Fellows, who often creep in&nbsp;under that Name, but the true Sailor, who&nbsp;can turn his hand to any thing rather than&nbsp;begging, and I am many times troubled to see&nbsp;the Miserable Conditions they and their Families are reduced to, when their Labours are&nbsp;done; Alms-Houses Raised for them, are as&nbsp;great Acts of Piety as Building of Churches;&nbsp;Age requires Relief, especially where Youth&nbsp;hath been spent in Labour so Profitable to the&nbsp;Publick as That of a Sailor; And not only&nbsp;themselves, but their Widows ought to be provided for; In this<span class="sni">Hospital for Ancient Sailors and their Widdows.</span> the Worshipful Society of the&nbsp;Merchants Adventurers within the City of&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bristol</span><span class="font6"> are a Worthy Pattern. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And as for those who loose their Lives or Limbs Fighting against the Enemy, Themselves or Families ought to be rewarded with&nbsp;Bountiful Stipends, which if Raised by a Tax,&nbsp;I doubt not would be cheerfully paid; ’Tis&nbsp;attended with sad Thoughts, when a Woman&nbsp;sees her Husband Prest into the Service, and&nbsp;knows if He miscarries her Family is undone, and She and They must come to the&nbsp;Parish; whereas if this Provision was made,&nbsp;the Fleet would be more easily Mann’d, our&nbsp;Merchants Ships better defended, Sailors more&nbsp;ready to serve in both, and their Wives to let&nbsp;them go; But great Care must be taken, that&nbsp;Charity be not Abused, by being put into the&nbsp;Pockets of those who are appointed to dispose&nbsp;of it. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These or such like Heads being laid down in a former Discourse on this Subject,&nbsp;the Magistrates of the City of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bristol</span><span class="font6"> were the&nbsp;first that approved of the Scheme, and&nbsp;desired the Substance thereof might be reduced&nbsp;to Particulars, suitable for that Place; whereupon the following Proposals were laid before&nbsp;them, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That a Spacious Work-House be erected in some Vacant Place within this City on a&nbsp;General Charge, large enough for the Poor&nbsp;who are to be Employed therein, and also with&nbsp;Rooms for such, who being unable to Work,&nbsp;are to be relieved by Charity. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Rules of this House be such, as may force all Persons to Work, that are able,&nbsp;and encourage the Manufacturers of this City&nbsp;to supply them with Materials to Work on;&nbsp;which they will be ready to do, having so&nbsp;good a Security as this will be for their&nbsp;being returned to them again when Wrought&nbsp;up. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That all People who are not able to maintain their Children, may put them into this Work-House or Hospital at what Ages&nbsp;they will, where they shall be settled till the&nbsp;Age of ### Years, by which means they may in the end be of no Charge to the said Work-House or Hospital; And the good Effects will be these, Children will be bred up&nbsp;to Labour, Principles of Virtue will be implanted in them early by the Good Government thereof, and Laziness and Beggary will&nbsp;be discouraged. </p>
<p class="font5" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That <span class="font6">the Antient People who are past their Labours shall have Lodgings, and&nbsp;Weekly Pay, or be otherwise provided for according to their Wants, who may still do&nbsp;something towards their Mantenance, and the&nbsp;Women may look after the young Children. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Rates of the Poor of this City, being all united into one common&nbsp;Fund, may be enough to carry on this good&nbsp;Work; By which means the Magistrates will&nbsp;be freed from the Trouble which they daily&nbsp;have about the Settlement of the Poor, the&nbsp;Parish-Officers will be eased, the Poors Stock&nbsp;will not be spent in Law, but they will be&nbsp;provided for, without being sent from Parish&nbsp;to Parish, and their Children will be settled&nbsp;in ways of being Serviceable to the Publick&nbsp;Good, and not be bred up in all manner of&nbsp;Vice, as now they are. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Governors of this Hospital or Work-House have Power to force all&nbsp;Poor People to Work in it, who do not betake themselves to some Lawful Imployment&nbsp;elsewhere, but spend their Time Lazily and&nbsp;Idly. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the said Governors have Power to settle out the young People at such Ages as&nbsp;they shall think fit; the Boys to Navigation,&nbsp;Husbandry, and Manufactures; the Maids in&nbsp;Service, and to bind them Apprentices for&nbsp;certain Years. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That this will prevent Children from being Starved, by the Poverty of their Parents,&nbsp;and neglect of the Parish Officers, which is&nbsp;now a great Loss to the Nation; forasmuch&nbsp;as every Person if Imployed, would by his&nbsp;Labour add to the Wealth of the Publick. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That this will encourage Men of Charity to make Endowments, when they&nbsp;shall see their Bounties so well laid out. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That Application be made, in order to procure an Act of Parliament, for the better&nbsp;Carrying on this Work. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Which Proposals being considered of in several Meetings of the Citizens Appointed for&nbsp;that Purpose, were with some Alterations&nbsp;made the Model for an Act of Parliament,&nbsp;which past <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Anno Septimo &amp; Octavo Gulielmi&nbsp;Tertii,</span><span class="font6"> being the first Act of that Nature,&nbsp;from which sundry Acts for many other Places have taken their Frame; and tho’ the&nbsp;Promoters thereof, met with more difficulties&nbsp;and discouragements in the Execution, than&nbsp;they did expect, yet to the Honour of those&nbsp;Gentlemen it must be said, that they never&nbsp;lookt back, but with the utmost Application,&nbsp;prosecuted what they had undertaken, till&nbsp;they brought it to such a State, as to render it&nbsp;Plain and Practicable to their Successors; And&nbsp;this good Effect it hath had, that there is not&nbsp;a common Beggar, or disorderly Vagrant,&nbsp;seen in their Streets, but Charity is given in&nbsp;its proper Place and Manner, and the Magistrates&nbsp;are freed from the daily Trouble they&nbsp;had with the Poor, and the Parishes they&nbsp;lived in, and are discharged from the Invidious Fatigues of their Settlements, when a&nbsp;great deal of what should have maintained&nbsp;them, was spent in determining what Parishes&nbsp;were to do it. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I wish it could be said so of the Two Metropolitan Cities of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, where such Swarms of Lazy Beggars pester the Streets,&nbsp;that they are not only Troublesome, but also&nbsp;Nauseous to the Beholders; And the Church&nbsp;Doors are so crouded with them, that you can&nbsp;scarce pass to your Devotion; nor do you&nbsp;know when you bestow your Charity rightly,&nbsp;Those who do not deserve it, taking such&nbsp;Methods to move Compassion, that you cannot easily distinguish them from those who&nbsp;do. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And since I have mentioned this Act, and the well Executing thereof by the first Undertakers, I think it cannot be amiss to set it&nbsp;forth <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Verbatim</span><span class="font6"> (being never yet Printed, save&nbsp;only some Copies for the Use of the Corporation) together with the steps whereby the&nbsp;first Guardians proceeded, and as it was laid&nbsp;before the Parliament </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Anno</span><span class="font6"> 1700; which I&nbsp;have done in the Appendix, because it may&nbsp;probably be of Use to those, who shall be willing to take Pains in a Work of such Service,&nbsp;both to God and the Publick. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But because this Act was adapted only for Cities and great Towns, and can’t be a&nbsp;Model for the Counties at large, I will here&nbsp;subjoyn such Methods as may be proper to&nbsp;carry on this Charitable Design throughout the&nbsp;whole Kingdom, if Power be given by some&nbsp;Publick Act of Parliament, for all Places to&nbsp;Incorporate who are willing (but may not be&nbsp;able to be at the Charge of a Private Act) and&nbsp;to Build, or otherwise Provide, Hospitals,&nbsp;Work-Houses, and Houses of Correction, for&nbsp;the better Maintaining and Imploying their&nbsp;Poor, under the Management of such Corporations; which in the Counties must be by&nbsp;uniting One or more Hundreds, whose Parishes&nbsp;must be comprehended in one Poors Rate,&nbsp;and each of them contribute to the Charge&nbsp;thereof, not by bringing them to an equal&nbsp;Pound Rate on their Lands and Personal&nbsp;Estates, as in Cities and great Towns, but by&nbsp;Taxing every Parish according to what it paid&nbsp;before, there not being the same Parity of&nbsp;Reason for that way of Raising Money in the&nbsp;Hundreds, as there is in Cities and Towns; because in the former, the Parishes do not receive an equal Benefit from the Labour of&nbsp;the Poor of other Parishes, as they do in the&nbsp;latter; which Hospitals, Work-Houses, and&nbsp;Houses of Correction, to be provided at the&nbsp;General Charge of the Parshies thus united,&nbsp;according to the Proportion that each of them&nbsp;pays to the Poor. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Guardians of these Corporations to consist of all the Justices of the Peace Inhabiting within the several Parishes thus united,&nbsp;together with a Number of Inhabitants chosen&nbsp;out of each Parish, in Proportion to the Sum&nbsp;of Money it Pays; which Choice to be made&nbsp;every Year, or once in Two Years, when one&nbsp;half of those that were first chosen must go&nbsp;out, and the Remainder stay in, to Instruct&nbsp;those who were last chosen; the Electors to&nbsp;be the Freeholders of ### <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Annum</span>; and on the Death of any Guardian, another to be chosen in his Room, by the Parish for&nbsp;which he served. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Guardians being thus settled, they shall have Power to chuse a Governor,&nbsp;Deputy-Governor, Treasurer, and Assistants,&nbsp;Yearly, and to hold Courts, and make&nbsp;By-Laws, and appoint a Common-Seal; and also to Summon the Inhabitants to answer to Matters relating to the Corporation; and to compel all People, who seek for Relief, to dwell in their Hospitals and Work-Houses, if they&nbsp;see fit; and to take in Young People of Both&nbsp;Sexes, and breed them up to Work, who they&nbsp;shall also be obliged to Teach to Write and&nbsp;Read, and what else shall be thought&nbsp;necessary, and then to bind them out Apprentices; and likewise to Provide for the Aged&nbsp;and Impotent, and to assist those whose Labours will not Maintain their Charges, and to&nbsp;apprehend Rogues, Vagrants and Beggars,&nbsp;and cause them to be set at Work, and also to&nbsp;inflict reasonable Correction where they see it&nbsp;necessary, and to entertain proper Officers,&nbsp;and pay them out of the Stock; with a Clause&nbsp;to secure them from vexatious Suits; And they&nbsp;must be obliged once in ### at least to hold a General Court, where the Governor, Deputy-Governor, or one half of the&nbsp;Assistants, together with such a proportionable&nbsp;Number of the Guardians as they shall agree&nbsp;on, shall be present. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Court shall once in Six Months agree and settle how much Money will be necessary for Maintaining and Imploying the&nbsp;Poor for the Six Months next ensuing, and&nbsp;certifie the same to the Justices inhabiting&nbsp;within the said Hundred or Hundreds, at a&nbsp;Meeting to be had for that Purpose, who shall&nbsp;proportion the same Regularity in each Parish,&nbsp;and grant out their Warrants to proper Persons to Assess the same, and afterwards, other&nbsp;Warrants to Collect, and Pay it to the&nbsp;Treasurer of the Corporation; with a Power to&nbsp;Inflict Penalties on the Assessors and Collectors,&nbsp;if they refuse or neglect to do their Duty, in&nbsp;Assessing, Collecting, and Paying the said&nbsp;Money, according to their Warrants. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That each Corporation be one Body Politick in Law, and be capable of Suing and being Sued, and be enabled to Purchase, Take and Receive, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, Goods and Chattles, for the Benefit of the Poor. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These, or such like Methods, being Rectified by the Wisdom of a Parliament, will&nbsp;soon appear to be of great Use to the Nation,&nbsp;and also to the Poor who are truly Objects&nbsp;of Relief; and will also put a stop to&nbsp;Wandering Vagrants, against whom, every&nbsp;Corporation will then be a Barrier, and none&nbsp;will expect Charity, but from the Parishes to&nbsp;which they belong, and who are the most&nbsp;proper Judges whether they do deserve it. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="sni">Conclusion.</span>And thus I have gone through what I Undertook, and have given my Thoughts of&nbsp;these Two Subjects; wherein I have no&nbsp;other View, than promoting the Welfare of this&nbsp;Kingdom, by Improving its Trade, and providing for the Poor in a Regular&nbsp;Method; Both which will tend to the Honour&nbsp;of His Majesties Government, and the advancing the Wealth and Prosperity of the Nation. </p>

<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I HUMBLY make bold to lay before You an Account of our&nbsp;Proceedings in the City of&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bristol</span><span class="font6">, on the Act of Parliament for Erecting Hospitals and</span> Work-houses for the better Employing and Maintaining the Poor of that City, which&nbsp;passed in the first Sessions of the Parliament&nbsp;begun at <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Westminster</span><span class="font6"> the 22d of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">November</span><span class="font6"></span> <span class="font6">1695. whereby the Power invested in the&nbsp;Corporation commenced from the 12th of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">May</span><span class="font6"> 1696. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The first Thing we did was to choose Four Guardians for each of our Twelve Wards,&nbsp;as the Statute does direct, which, with the&nbsp;Mayor and Aldermen, amounted to Sixty&nbsp;Guardians, and made up our Court. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Court being thus constituted, at our first Meeting we chose our Officers appointed&nbsp;by the said Act, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> a Governor, a&nbsp;Deputy-Governor, Twelve Assistants, a Treasurer, a&nbsp;Clerk, and a Beadle. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">This being done, we order’d the Guardians who dwelt in each Parish, to bring in an Account of all the Poor in their respective&nbsp;Parishes, their Names, Ages, Sexes, and&nbsp;Qualifications. Also an Account of the&nbsp;Charges expended for maintaining them in&nbsp;each of the last three Years, that so we might&nbsp;bring it to a <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Medium</span><span class="font6">. We also appointed&nbsp;certain standing Rules for the better governing our Debates, and ordered all things done&nbsp;in the Court to be fairly enter’d in a Journal. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We likewise consider’d which would be most for the advantage of the Corporation, to&nbsp;build Work-houses, or to purchase such&nbsp;Houses, which being already built, might be&nbsp;altered and made fit for our purpose. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These things spent much time, and it was about the Month of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">September</span><span class="font6"> before we&nbsp;could settle the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Medium</span><span class="font6"> of the Poor’s Rates,&nbsp;in order to certifie to the Mayor and Aldermen what Sum was necessary to be Raised on&nbsp;the City for the next Year. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But here we met with an unexpected <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Remora</span><span class="font6">, Mr. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Samuel Wallis</span><span class="font6"> was succeeded in&nbsp;his Majoralty by Mr. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J. H.</span><span class="font6"> and this Change&nbsp;made a great Alteration in our Affairs: For&nbsp;whereas the former had given us all the Incouragement we could expect from him, and&nbsp;had done us the honour to be our first Governor, the latter resolved to obstruct us all&nbsp;he could. And because the power of raising&nbsp;Money was vested in him and the Aldermen,&nbsp;he absolutely refused to put that Power in&nbsp;Execution. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">This, together with his other Endeavours to Brow-beat the Corporation, kept us at a stand till <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">October</span><span class="font6"> (97.) only our Court&nbsp;met, and discourst things, and we laboured&nbsp;to keep up the Spirits of our Friends, who&nbsp;began to sink under these Discouragements,&nbsp;and to despair of Success, the Work seeming&nbsp;difficult enough in it self; our undertaking&nbsp;being nothing less, then to put to Work a&nbsp;great Number of People, many of which&nbsp;had been habited to Laziness and Beggary;&nbsp;to civilize such as had been bred up in all the&nbsp;Vices that want of Education could expose&nbsp;them to; and to Clothe, Lodge, and feed&nbsp;them well, with the same Sum of Money&nbsp;which was distributed among them when&nbsp;they begg’d, lay in the Streets, and went&nbsp;almost naked. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Yet all this would not have discouraged us, could we have prevailed on Mr. Mayor&nbsp;to have joyned with us. We often sought it,&nbsp;and he as often refused us, till his time being expired, his Successor granted our Request; and then, having lost much time, we&nbsp;were forced to make large steps. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The first we made was, a Vote to take on us the Care of the Poor of the City; and&nbsp;as I remember, this Vote passed in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">October&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">November</span><span class="font6"> 1697. though we had then no&nbsp;Money raised, nor could we expect any till&nbsp;after our </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lady-day</span><span class="font6"> 1698. So that from the&nbsp;passing that Vote to this time is about two&nbsp;Years. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The next step was to appoint a Committee of Twelve to hear the Complaints of the Poor, to relieve them, and set them&nbsp;at work; Six whereof were to go out every&nbsp;Month, and to be succeeded by Six more,&nbsp;to be chosen by Ballating. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We had formerly obtained from the Mayor and Common Council, in the Majoralty of&nbsp;Alderman <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Wallis</span><span class="font6">, the Grant of a Work-house,&nbsp;which then lay unoccupied, and the Court&nbsp;had appointed a Committee to place as many&nbsp;Girls in it as it would conveniently contain,&nbsp;both as to Lodging and Working. This is&nbsp;that we called the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New work-house</span><span class="font6">. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But all things having stood still so long, we resolved now to lose no more time; yet&nbsp;we had no Money, nor could we expect any&nbsp;in less than Six Months, from the Poor’s&nbsp;Rates; therefore we resolved to make our&nbsp;several Loans for Twelve Months without Interest to the Corporation on the Credit of&nbsp;their Common Seal; in which Design many&nbsp;of the Citizens lent their Assistance, whereby&nbsp;we became soon Masters of about Six Hundred Pounds Stock. Likewise our Guardians, who were appointed to pay the Poor in their&nbsp;several Parishes, voluntarily advanced their&nbsp;weekly Payments, till they could be reimburst by the Treasurer. The other Stock&nbsp;we Employed to furnish Beds and other Necessaries for our House, Clothes and Provisions for our Children to be taken in, and&nbsp;Materials for their Working. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We had now Two Committees; one for the Poor, the other for the New&nbsp;Work-house. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Committee for the Poor met twice every Week: And in this Committee we&nbsp;proceeded thus; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">First,</span><span class="font6"> We Voted that the Poor of the City should be visited in their respective Parishes,&nbsp;and that new Poor’s Rates should be made;&nbsp;and accordingly we ordered the Guardians of&nbsp;each Parish to bring together the Poor on a&nbsp;certain day in some convenient Place, where&nbsp;the Committee met, and without Partiality&nbsp;endeavoured to provide for every one according to their Wants, We likewise took notice of all the young Girls that were on our&nbsp;Poor’s Books, and of such whose Parents took&nbsp;no due Care of them; and these we recommended to the Committee of the New&nbsp;Work-house, to be taken in, and Employed by&nbsp;them. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Our Poor’s Rates we made in this manner: Every One that expected Relief came before us with their whole Families, except&nbsp;such as was impotent and could not come:&nbsp;In our Books we put down the Name of&nbsp;the Man, the Woman, and each Child;&nbsp;together with the Qualifications of all, either&nbsp;as to Age, Health, Civility, &amp;c. what each&nbsp;Person did or could get by the Week, and&nbsp;in what Employment. We likewise set&nbsp;down for what Reason the Charity was bestowed, that when that should cease, or we&nbsp;could find out any other way to provide for&nbsp;it, the Charity should likewise cease. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Having thus seen the state of all our Poor, and provided for them, the Committee&nbsp;sat twice a Week in the Publick Court, to&nbsp;hear and provide for all casual Complaints;&nbsp;which we did in this Manner; We ordered&nbsp;that the Poor in their respective Parishes,&nbsp;should first apply themselves to their Guardian or Guardians, who were to relieve them&nbsp;as they saw fit, till the next Sitting of the&nbsp;Committee, when they were to bring them&nbsp;up with their Complaints, if they were able&nbsp;to come; and this we did, lest the Committee (three whereof made a <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Quorum</span><span class="font6">) should&nbsp;be deceived; who could not be supposed to&nbsp;know the state of all the Poor in the City,&nbsp;and by this means we had the Opinion of&nbsp;the Guardian of each Parish; nor could he&nbsp;easily deceive us, because he brought the Poor&nbsp;with him, and thereby the Committee became Judges of the Matter laid before them.&nbsp;At these Meetings, care was taken of the various Cases and Exigencies which offered, and&nbsp;in all things there was a regard, as much as&nbsp;could be, to put People on living by their own&nbsp;Labours. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">To such as were sick, we gave Warrants to our Physician to visit them; such as wanted the Assistance of our Surgeons were directed to them, and all were Relieved till&nbsp;they were able to Work; by which means&nbsp;the Poor having been well attended, were set&nbsp;at Work again, who by neglect, might with&nbsp;their Families have been chargeable to the&nbsp;Corporation; for some we provided Cloaths,&nbsp;for others Work; where we found People&nbsp;careful, but wanted a Stock to Employ themselves and their Children, we either lent or gave&nbsp;it; where they wanted Houses, we either&nbsp;paid the Rent, or became Security for it;&nbsp;where we found them opprest, we stood by&nbsp;them; where Differences arose, we endeavoured to compose them; so that in a little&nbsp;time all the Complaints of the Poor came to&nbsp;this Committee, (which saved our Magistrates&nbsp;a great deal of trouble) and care was taken&nbsp;that none went away unheard. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Committee at first sat twice a Week, but now only once in a Fortnight; not that&nbsp;we grew slack in the Care of our Poor, but&nbsp;because their Number being so much abated,&nbsp;by those received into our several&nbsp;Work-houses, the Business does not require their meeting oftner. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The other Committee, (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6">) That for the New Work-house, having first furnished it in&nbsp;order to receive in the young Girls, began&nbsp;with such as were recommended to them by&nbsp;the Committee for the Poor; and this Method hath been generally observed ever since,&nbsp;both by that Committee, and also by the Committee since chosen for our other Work-house;&nbsp;not that either of them depends on the other,&nbsp;but because the first application for Relief is&nbsp;made to the Committee for the Poor. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But before we took in the Girls, we first considered of proper Officers to govern them;&nbsp;and these consisted of a Master, whose Business was to receive in Work, and deliver it&nbsp;out again, and to keep the Account of the&nbsp;House, &amp;c. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">A Mistress, whose Business was to look after the Kitchen and Lodgings, to provide&nbsp;their Meals at set times, and other things&nbsp;which related to the Government of the&nbsp;House. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Tutresses to teach them to Spin, under each of which we put Five and Twenty Girls. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">A School-Mistress, to teach them to Read. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Servants in the Kitchen, and for washing, &amp;c. but these we soon discharged, and caused our biggest Girls to take their Turns&nbsp;every Week. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We also appointed an old Man to keep the Door, and to carry forth and fetch in Work,&nbsp;and such kind of Services. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Being thus provided, we received in One Hundred Girls, and set them to Work at Spinning of Worsted Yarn; all which we first&nbsp;caused to be stript by the Mistress, Washed,&nbsp;and new Clothed from Head to Foot; which,&nbsp;together with wholesome Dyet at set Hours,&nbsp;and good Beds to Lye on, so incouraged the&nbsp;Children, that they willingly betook themselves to their Work. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We likewise provided for them Apparel for <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sundays</span><span class="font6">; they went to Church every Lord’s&nbsp;Day; were taught their Catechisms at home,&nbsp;and had Prayers twice every Day; we appointed them set Hours for working, eating, and&nbsp;playing; and gave them leave to walk on&nbsp;the Hills with their Tutresses, when their&nbsp;Work was over, and the Weather fair; by&nbsp;which means we won them into Civility, and&nbsp;a love to their Labour. But we had a great&nbsp;deal of trouble with their Parents, and those&nbsp;who formerly kept them, who having lost the&nbsp;sweetness of their Pay, did all they could to&nbsp;set both their Children and others against us;&nbsp;but this was soon over. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Hitherto things answered above our Expectations; our Children grew sober, and&nbsp;Worked willingly, but we very much questioned, whether their Labours at the Rates we&nbsp;were paid, would answer the charge of their&nbsp;Maintenance; and if not, our great doubt&nbsp;was how we might advance it, without prejudicing the Manufactures. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">To clear the first, we supposed our selves in a fair way, having appointed their Diets to&nbsp;be made up of such Provisions as were very&nbsp;wholesome, afforded good nourishment, and&nbsp;were not costly in Price, (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6">) Beef, Pease, Potatoes, Broath, Pease-porridge, Milk-porridge,&nbsp;Bread and Cheese, good Bear, (such as we&nbsp;drank at our own Tables) Cabage, Carrots,&nbsp;Turnips, &amp;c. in which we took the Advice&nbsp;of our Physician, and bought the best of every&nbsp;sort. They had three Meals every day, and&nbsp;as I remember, it stood us (with Soap to&nbsp;wash) in about Sixteen pence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Week for&nbsp;each of the One hundred Girls. We soon&nbsp;found the effect of their Change of Living,&nbsp;Nature being well supported, threw out a&nbsp;great deal of foulness, so that we had generally Twenty down at a time, in the Measels,&nbsp;Small-pox, and other Distempers; but by the&nbsp;Care of our Physician, and the Blessing of&nbsp;God on his Endeavours, we never Buried but&nbsp;Two, though we have had seldom less than&nbsp;One hundred in the House at any time. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Having thus provided for their Dyets, we next appointed their times of Working;&nbsp;which in the Summer was Ten hours and a&nbsp;half every Day, and an Hour less in the&nbsp;Winter; by which means we answered the&nbsp;two Objections raised against the Poor, (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6">) That they will not Work, and that they spend&nbsp;what they get in fine feeding. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But we soon found, that the great cause of begging did proceed from the low Wages&nbsp;for Labour; for after about Eight Months&nbsp;time, our Children could not get half so<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">much as we expended in their Provisions.&nbsp;The Manufacturers, who Employed us, were&nbsp;always complaining the Yarn was spun course,&nbsp;but would not advance above Eight pence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">Pound for Spinning, and we must either take&nbsp;this, or have no Work. On the other side,&nbsp;we were labouring to understand how we&nbsp;might distinguish, and put a Value on our&nbsp;Work, according to its Fineness. This we&nbsp;did by the Snap Reel, which when we were&nbsp;Masters of, the Committee made an Order,&nbsp;That the Master should buy in a Stock of&nbsp;Wool, and Spin it up for our own Accounts,&nbsp;and then proceeded to set the Price of Spinning by the Snap Reel, wherein we endeavoured to discourage Course Work, and to Encourage Fine, because we saw the latter was&nbsp;likely to bring more Profit, not only to the&nbsp;Poor, but to the Kingdom in general. We&nbsp;likewise ordered some things to be made up&nbsp;of the several sorts of Yarn, at the Rates&nbsp;we had set them; and on the whole, we&nbsp;found the Commodities made of fine Yarn, though they were much better than those&nbsp;made of Course, yet stood us in little more;&nbsp;because what the one exceeded in the charge&nbsp;of Spinning, was very much made good in&nbsp;abatement of the Quantity used. We therefore sent to the Manufacturers, and shewed&nbsp;them what Experiments we had made; but&nbsp;finding them still unwilling to advance above&nbsp;the old Rate, the Committee Voted that they&nbsp;would give Employment to all the Poor of&nbsp;the City, who would make application to&nbsp;them, at the Rates we offered to work,&nbsp;and pay them ready Money for their Labour. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We soon found we had taken the right Course, for in a few Weeks we had Sale for&nbsp;our Fine Yarn as fast as we could make it,&nbsp;and they gave us from Eight pence to Two&nbsp;Shillings <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Pound for Spinning the same&nbsp;Goods, for which a little before they paid but&nbsp;Eight pence, and were very well pleased with&nbsp;it, because they were now able to distinguish&nbsp;between the Fine and the Course Yarn, and to&nbsp;apply each sort to the use for which it was&nbsp;most proper: Since which, they have given&nbsp;us Two Shillings and Six Pence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Pound&nbsp;for a great many Pounds, and we Spin some&nbsp;worth Three Shillings and Six Pence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Pound&nbsp;Spinning. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">By this means we had the pleasure of seeing the Children’s Labour advanced, which a&nbsp;little before I came up, amounted to near&nbsp;Six Pounds <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Week, and would have been&nbsp;much more, but that our biggest Girls, we&nbsp;either settle forth, or put in the Kitchen;&nbsp;and those we receive in being generally small,&nbsp;are able to do but little for some time&nbsp;after. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The encouragement we had received on this beginning, put us on proceeding further:&nbsp;The Court resolved to purchase a great Sugar-House, out of the Money directed by the&nbsp;Act to be raised for Building of&nbsp;Work-Houses, and fit it up for the receiving in the&nbsp;remainder of the Poor, (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6">) ancient People, Boys, and young Children; which was&nbsp;accordingly done, and a Committee was&nbsp;appointed to manage it. This we called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mint Work-House</span><span class="font6">, because it had been&nbsp;hired by the Lords of the Treasury for that Use. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Committee began to take in the Boys in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">August</span><span class="font6"> last; these we Cloathed, Dyeted, and&nbsp;Governed, much after the same manner as we&nbsp;had done the Girls, but put them on a different Employment, (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6">) Spinning of Cotton&nbsp;Wool, and Weaving of Fustians: We have&nbsp;now about One Hundred of them together,<sup>&nbsp;</sup>who settle well to their Work, and every&nbsp;Day mend their Hands; they get us already&nbsp;Six Pounds </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Week; they are likewise&nbsp;taught to Read, and we shall hereafter teach&nbsp;them to Write. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We next took in our ancient People; and here we had principally a regard to such as&nbsp;were impotent, and had no Friends to help&nbsp;them, and to such as we could not keep from&nbsp;the lazy Trade of Begging; these we Cloathed&nbsp;as we saw they needed, and put on such Employments as were fit for their Ages and&nbsp;Strengths, having our Eyes chiefly on those&nbsp;to which they were bred; we found it difficult at first to bend them down to good Orders, but by degrees we have brought them&nbsp;under Government. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Then we called in all the Children that were on our Poor’s Books, and put them under Nurses; those who can speak and go, are carried down into the School, to learn&nbsp;their <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font6">, &amp;c. As they grow up, we&nbsp;shall put them into the Working Rooms. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Boys are kept at a distance from the ancient People, who do also lodge in distinct&nbsp;Apartments, the Men in several Chambers&nbsp;on one Floor, and the Women on another;&nbsp;all do something, though perhaps some of&nbsp;their Labours comes to little, yet it keeps&nbsp;them from Idleness: Both the Old and Young&nbsp;attend Prayers twice a day, (except the Bedridden, for whom other Care is taken) and go&nbsp;to Church twice on <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sun days</span><span class="font6">. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">We have now three standing Committees, (<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6">) For the Poor, for the New&nbsp;Work-house, and for the Mint Work-house: The&nbsp;first gives all Directions, and makes all Allowances, for the Poor, without whose Order&nbsp;no Guardian can act any thing considerable,&nbsp;except in Cases of absolute Necessity, which&nbsp;at the next Meeting of the Committee he&nbsp;must give an Account of, and desire their&nbsp;Approbation. The other two Committees&nbsp;have Power to Act in the Affairs of that&nbsp;Work-House for which they are chosen:&nbsp;They receive in both Old and Young; they&nbsp;bind forth Apprentices, Correct, order the </span>Dyet as they please, oversee the Working, Sell the Manufactures when made, order the&nbsp;Payment of all Moneys, which cannot be&nbsp;done unless the Note be sign’d by the Chair-man; and generally direct every thing relating to those Houses. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Accounts are made up thus: The Treasurers Account is audited every Year,&nbsp;by a Committee chosen for that purpose;&nbsp;at which time he is succeeded by another&nbsp;Treasurer, chosen by the Court: The Accounts of the Guardians who pay the Poor in&nbsp;their several Parishes are audited every Three&nbsp;Months, by a select Committee chosen&nbsp;likewise by the Court, and are then paid by the&nbsp;Treasurer: The Accounts for each&nbsp;Workhouse are audited by the respective Committee&nbsp;every Month, when the Master adjusts, not&nbsp;only his Account of Cash, but also of each&nbsp;particular <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Specie</span><span class="font6"> of Goods he hath under his&nbsp;Care, the Ballance whereof is still carried forward to the next, which when allowed of is&nbsp;signed by the Chairman: And the Account&nbsp;for each House is so stated, that it shews at&nbsp;one sight, what the House is indebted; what&nbsp;Debts are outstanding, and from whom; what </span>Goods remain in the House, and the Quantity of each <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Specie. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">At the making up these Accounts nothing (unless very trivial) is allowed, for which an&nbsp;Order is not produced, or found entered&nbsp;in our Books, so that ’tis very difficult to&nbsp;wrong the Corporation of any thing, if the&nbsp;Guardians should endeavour it. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">These Committees keep their Journal Books, wherein all they do is fairly transcribed, and signed by the Chairman. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">This is what at present occurs to my Memory touching our Work-Houses at <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bristol</span><span class="font6">;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">I have been as brief as the nature of the thing&nbsp;would admit: The Success hath answered our&nbsp;Expectation; we are freed from Beggars, our&nbsp;old People are comfortably provided for; our&nbsp;Boys and Girls are educated to Sobriety, and&nbsp;brought to delight in Labour; our young&nbsp;Children are well lookt after, and not spoiled&nbsp;by the neglect of ill Nurses; and the Face of&nbsp;our City is so changed already, that we have&nbsp;great reason to hope these young Plants will&nbsp;produce a vertuous and laborious Generation,&nbsp;with whom Immortality and Prophaness may&nbsp;find little Incouragement; nor does our hopes&nbsp;appear to be groundless, for among Three&nbsp;Hundred Persons now under our Charge within Doors, there is neither Cursing nor Swearing, nor prophane Language, to be heard,&nbsp;though many of them were bred up in all&nbsp;manner of Vices, which neither </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bridewell&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">nor Whippings could fright them from, because, returning to their bad Company for&nbsp;want of Employment, they were rather made&nbsp;worse then bettered by those Corrections;&nbsp;whereas the Change we have wrought on&nbsp;them is by fair means. We have a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bridewell</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Stocks</span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whipping-Post</span><span class="font6">, always in&nbsp;their sights, but never had occasion to make&nbsp;use of either. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">What is done in that City, I humbly hope may be carried on by the same steps&nbsp;throughout the Kingdom; The Poor may be&nbsp;set at Work, their Wages advanced without&nbsp;danger to our Manufactures, and they thereby enabled to live on their own Labours,&nbsp;whereby the Charge of the Poor’s Rates may&nbsp;be saved, and a great many worthy Benefactors encouraged to give, when they shall see&nbsp;their Charity so well disposed of. This I have&nbsp;great reason to hope, because we have had&nbsp;near One Thousand Pounds freely given to us&nbsp;within the compass of one Year, and much&nbsp;thereof by Gentlemen who dwelt at a Distance from us, only were willing to Encourage a Work they saw likely to be carried&nbsp;on, which might be of good Example to the&nbsp;Nation. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 100pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I am, </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center"><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">ESSAY</span></h2>
<p class="font7" style="text-align:center">Towards Setling a</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center"><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">NATIONAL CREDIT. </span></h2>
<p class="font7" style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 40pt 0pt;">First Published in the Year, MDCXCVI. </p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">To the Right Honourable the LORDS Spiritual and Temporal, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">and to&nbsp;the Honourable the Commons of&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">ENGLAND </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in Parliament As</span><span class="font6"></span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sembled. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">HAVING lately presented your Honours with <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">An Essay on Coin&nbsp;and Credit</span><span class="font6">, the chief Design&nbsp;whereof was to shew the Necessity of Setling a well-grounded&nbsp;Credit in this Nation, for Support of the&nbsp;Government, and carrying on its Trade; I&nbsp;do now with all Humility lay before you Proposals to answer that end, which I have not&nbsp;clogg’d with Compulsion to the Subject, supposing nothing of this Nature can be good,&nbsp;where a Common Consent, grounded upon&nbsp;Interest, doth not make it valuable. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Banks, as I humbly conceive, ought chiefly to be Calculated for the Use of Trade, and&nbsp;modeled so as may best content the Traders.&nbsp;What gives them Satisfaction, will answer&nbsp;all other Occasions of the Kingdom. Money passes through the Hands of the Nobility and Gentry, only as Water doth through&nbsp;Conduit-Pipes into the Cistern, but Centers&nbsp;in the Hands of Traders, where it Circulates, and may be said to be used; and&nbsp;among these, Ease, Profit, and Security, are&nbsp;Arguments strong enough to keep a Bank always full; Besides, when the Streights of the Government&nbsp;are taken off, greater Sums will come into&nbsp;Trade, which are now drawn out, in order to&nbsp;make Advantages, above what the Profits of&nbsp;Trade will bring in. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Heads whereon I propose to build this National Credit, are these which follow: </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That a Bank be Erected on the Credit of the Parliament, the Profit or Loss thereof to&nbsp;redound to the Nation, whose chief Chamber shall be setled in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6">, but lesser&nbsp;Chambers in other Places of this Kingdom,&nbsp;at such Distances, as may best Answer the&nbsp;Occasions of the Country; which Chambers to account with that of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6">, and&nbsp;that to Commissioners appointed by Parliament. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That this Bank shall take in what running Cash shall be offered, and shall give their Notes for it; and shall also allow Interest after the Rate of ### <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent. per&nbsp;Annum,</span><span class="font6"> after the first ### days, till those</span> Notes be paid, and shall also pay it again to the Proprietors, or any part thereof, when&nbsp;demanded. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That if any Man puts in his Money for a time certain, not less then ### Months, he shall receive Interest from the time of paying it in, to the time he is repaid. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That this Bank shall let out any Sum again on reasonable Security, either Real, Personal, or Goods, receiving Interest after the&nbsp;Rate of ### <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent. per Annum</span><span class="font6">, till the&nbsp;Borrower shall think fit to pay it in, which&nbsp;he shall do, by such Parts as will best suit his&nbsp;Occasions, and be discharged from the Interest&nbsp;of what he so pays, and only pay after the&nbsp;Rate aforesaid, for so much as doth remain&nbsp;in his hands. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That Lombards be Erected to attend this Bank, for the Benefit of Traders,&nbsp;under Regulations, which may encourage&nbsp;Trade. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That for the Benefit of Returns, the Notes given in any one Chamber of this&nbsp;Bank, shall be demandable in any other, together with the Interest due till payment, the&nbsp;Receiver allowing for such Returns after the&nbsp;Rate of ### for each Hundred pounds, in the Chamber where he receives his Money. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That to prevent Counterfeits, all Notes given out at any Chamber, shall be made payable to ### or Order, and Assigned from one to another, each Assigner to be Warrantee for the Note, both to the Bank, and also to&nbsp;every later Assignee. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That these Notes shall be taken by the King in all Payments, which will make them&nbsp;currant among the Subjects. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That this Bank do supply the King with all Loans at ### <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> Interest </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Ann.</span><span class="font6"> from&nbsp;the time of borrowing to the time the&nbsp;Money is paid in again, and that it hath the&nbsp;Taxes, or Funds settled by Act of Parliament,&nbsp;for its Security. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That all Debts Contracted to this Bank, shall be of the same Nature with Debts Contracted to the King, and be first paid out of&nbsp;the Estates of the Debtors; and that Extents shall lye accordingly. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That an Account be kept of Profit and Loss in each Chamber, together with the&nbsp;Charges of the Officers, &amp;c. And that it be&nbsp;return’d up every Three Months, as also Account Current, to the Grand Chamber in&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6">, where the whole shall be Examined&nbsp;by the Commissioners, and they be liable to</span><span class="font9">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">the inspection of the Parliament. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That Registers for Lands be erected in all Counties, &amp;c. where desired, by Act of&nbsp;Parliament. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That Bills be past on the Bank by such as are appointed to buy for the Publick Use&nbsp;of the Nation, payable at the time of their&nbsp;Agreement; by which means every one will&nbsp;endeavour to Furnish the Government Cheapest, when their payments shall be punctual;&nbsp;the King will save a great deal of Moneys,&nbsp;paid now for Procuration, Excessive Interest,&nbsp;&amp;c. and the Fleet and Army will be well&nbsp;paid. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Commissioners do once every Year at least, make up the Accounts depending between the Publick and the Bank, allowing ### <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> Interest as before; </span>and make application to the Parliament for its Reimbursement. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That Bills and Bonds be made Assignable by Law, and the Property be thereby transfer’d to the Assigne. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That Trustees may put the Money belonging to <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Orphans</span><span class="font6"> into this Bank, which shall be a discharge to them for so much of&nbsp;their Trust, the Interest to be duly issued out&nbsp;for the maintenance of the said </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Orphans</span><span class="font6">; and&nbsp;that all Plate and Bullion belonging to the&nbsp;said </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Orphans</span><span class="font6"> be by the Trustees Coined up at&nbsp;the next Mint, and the Money put into the&nbsp;Bank for the use of the said </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Orphans</span><span class="font6">. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">That the Money in this Bank be freed from Taxes. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Concerning which Credit I shall briefly speak to these Four Things. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I. First, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Its Security. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">II. Secondly, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Some of those Advantages the Nation will reap by it. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">III. Thirdly, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I shall make some Comparison between this Credit, and the present Bank of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">England. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">IV. Fourthly, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I shall set forth the necessity of setling the Nations Credit in this present&nbsp;Sessions. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I. As to the <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">First,</span><span class="font6"> It hath the Legislative Power of the Kingdom of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> for its&nbsp;Foundation, a Security strong enough, and&nbsp;nothing else can be so, to build this Great Superstructure upon, the well Modeling whereof,&nbsp;will keep it from being subject to the Designs&nbsp;of Private Persons; This will last so long as&nbsp;the Peoples Liberties last, for no Change can&nbsp;weaken it, so long as the People of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">have a hand in making their own Laws, whose&nbsp;Common Interest will be so Riveted and Made&nbsp;up with the Security of this Bank, that they&nbsp;will in a short time become one thing, so that&nbsp;nothing less than a Conquest will be able to&nbsp;shake it; This we cannot fear from any Nation besides the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6">, nor from them neither,&nbsp;till </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Holland</span><span class="font6"> is first subdued; therefore, as those&nbsp;States must first truckle, so far will our Bank&nbsp;be more secure than theirs; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font6"> cannot&nbsp;Erect a Bank on any sort of Security, because,&nbsp;the Will of that Prince being his Law, alters&nbsp;according to his present Occasions; Nor can&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6"> do it; where, not only the Government,&nbsp;but also the Profits thereof, are divided&nbsp;amongst its Ministers; As for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sweden</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Denmark</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Portugal</span><span class="font6">, the Princes of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Italy</span><span class="font6"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Germany</span><span class="font6">, few believe their Circumstances to&nbsp;be such, as to Render them capable of Erecting a Bank, which may draw the Eyes of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font6"> to look towards it; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> only can&nbsp;do it, for as an easie Government is its own&nbsp;Security, so that Security encourages Trade,&nbsp;and these two, accompanied with the Profits&nbsp;offered to a Running Cash, will make all </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font6"> desire to settle their Moneys here. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Seeing then, that nothing but the same Power which first Constituted this Bank can&nbsp;destroy it, (a Power with whom we Intrust&nbsp;our Lives, Liberties, and Estates) I cannot&nbsp;see the least Room left for distrust; for what&nbsp;Advantage can any future Parliament expect&nbsp;by a design of seizing this Bank, when the&nbsp;Treasure thereof may be drawn out, whilst&nbsp;they are framing the Law; and the Consequence will be, the Ruining their&nbsp;own Estates, for which they can promise nothing to themselves, save the being possest of&nbsp;Empty Papers. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">What farther Hazard the Nation can run, must proceed from the Neglect of the&nbsp;Managers, or the Fraud of under Officers,&nbsp;which, Care in the First, and Security for&nbsp;the Last, will prevent. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">II. The next Thing is to shew the Advantages which <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> will reap by Setling the Credit here proposed; whereof some do&nbsp;Immediately attend it, others are Consequential. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Those which Immediately attend it, are, </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1st, The Rate of Interest will hereby be brought lower, to the Advance of our Lands,&nbsp;and Encouragement of our Trade, by&nbsp;Methods altogether as Profitable to the Usurer,&nbsp;who will be willing to let his Money Cheaper,&nbsp;when it shall never lye dead without his Consent, his Security be unquestionable, and freed&nbsp;from the Charges of litigious Suits, which so&nbsp;frequently accompany doubtfull Mortgages. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2dly, Both Gentlemen and Traders will hereby be supplied with Money to serve their&nbsp;Occasions, on such reasonable Security as they&nbsp;are able to give, when that Security shall be&nbsp;strengthned, by having the Preheminence&nbsp;above all other Obligations; They may also&nbsp;have liberty to pay it in by such Proportions,&nbsp;as they can best spare it, when it shall be&nbsp;equally the Interest of the Bank to receive it&nbsp;so, which will never want new opportunities&nbsp;to let it out again. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">3dly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">This Credit will give us an Esteem in Foreign Parts, Draw their Moneys hither,&nbsp;and consequently their Trade, and thereby&nbsp;their People, all which will be an Advantage&nbsp;to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">4ly, It will supply the Government with Money to carry on the War on Moderate Interest, and make its Credit good; whereby&nbsp;the Publick Revenues will Reach farther to serve&nbsp;its Occasions, and the Ministers of State be&nbsp;freed from many anxious Thoughts, which&nbsp;now make them Uneasie. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">5ly, It will make Returns from place to place in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> both Cheap and Certain,&nbsp;which will help our Inland Trade, and prevent Robberies, now too much encouraged&nbsp;by travelling with Money; It will also be&nbsp;profitable to our Foreign Trade, by bringing&nbsp;Exchanges low in our favour. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">6ly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">The Frauds put on the Country by Counterfeit Notes will be prevented; for&nbsp;though the method of Indentures and Stained&nbsp;Paper now used by the Bank of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">, may&nbsp;be a Security to it self, yet it is not so to any&nbsp;one else, seeing Art is able to Counterfeit every&nbsp;thing, at least so like, as not to be easily&nbsp;discover’d: Now, what Satisfaction will it be&nbsp;to those who have received their Notes instead&nbsp;of Money, to be told by the Managers that&nbsp;they are Counterfeit, when they know not&nbsp;where, nor from whom to get Reparation;&nbsp;whereas being Assigned from Man to Man,&nbsp;they are taken on the Credit of the Assignor,&nbsp;who runs no other risque thereby, save his&nbsp;Warrant that they are truly what he pays&nbsp;them for. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">7ly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">This Bank will be free from Stock-Jobbing, the Bane of all good Designs,&nbsp;which will find no room here, because it&nbsp;cannot be divided into private and particular&nbsp;Interests. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Consequential Advantages will be these, </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">1st, By this means the Taxes for carrying on the War the ensuing Year, together with&nbsp;the Twenty five hundred and Sixty four&nbsp;Thousand Pounds, which fell short on the&nbsp;Salt Fund, may be raised, by Methods, wherein the Kings Revenue, and the Peoples Profits, shall go hand in hand, without Anticipations. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">2ly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">The Funds now setled on our Manufactures, which discourage our Trade, and Ruin our Poor, may be sunk and taken off;&nbsp;such as those on the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Glass-makers</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tobaccopip-makers</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;Distillers</span><span class="font6">, and others, many whereof&nbsp;have yielded little to the Government, above&nbsp;the Charge of Collecting, and the best of them&nbsp;have done great mischief to our Trade; Now&nbsp;seeing these are only so many several Modus’s of raising Money, those methods must&nbsp;doubtless do Best, which least Injure our&nbsp;Trade. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">3ly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">The Debt due to the Transport-Ships may be paid off, and those People, to&nbsp;whose Early Loyalty the Reduction of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> is very much owing, be Contented. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">4ly, The Mints may be kept Imployed, and the Kingdom thereby filled with Coin. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">5ly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">Our Wooll may be kept at home, which I humbly conceive can never be done,&nbsp;till a good Credit be settled, any thing less&nbsp;will not be large enough to cover the Sore&nbsp;Intended to be Cured. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">6ly, The Plantation Trade may be better secured, especially that of Tobacco, and Methods may be proposed to Render it more Profitable, both to the King, and also to the&nbsp;Subject. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">7ly,<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font6">The Bank of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">’s Notes may be brought to Par, and Tallies of all sorts&nbsp;in a short time be paid off at their full Value,&nbsp;which I humbly conceive will be difficult to&nbsp;be done, any other way, the settling a Credit&nbsp;on either, or grafting them both together,&nbsp;seem improbable Methods to answer those&nbsp;ends. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">I humbly hope to make Proposals in this present Sessions for putting these into Practise,&nbsp;if a good Credit be timely setled. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Besides these, many other Advantages will accrue to the Nation, many of which I<span class="font9">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">have set forth in my before Recited Essay on&nbsp;Coin and Credit. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pag.</span><span class="font6"> 27, 28, 29. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">III. The Third thing is to make some Comparison between the Credit here proposed, and the present Bank of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">which I humbly conceive is so shaken in its&nbsp;Reputation, as hath rendred it uncapable to&nbsp;be made the Foundation of a National Credit;&nbsp;and whilst we labour to recover it, we may&nbsp;run the hazard of destroying our Trade, disturbing the Government, and keeping our&nbsp;selves under a lingring War, whilst we Encourage the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> King, to try his Utmost Efforts, hoping, that our Difficulties at home,&nbsp;will force us to accept of a dishonourable&nbsp;Peace. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">’Tis certain, Nothing can be the Support of a National Credit, which is not better, or&nbsp;at least so good as Money; and this is not to&nbsp;be found in the Bank of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">, whose&nbsp;Notes whilst they are One </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> worse&nbsp;than Specie, will always keep their Coffers&nbsp;Empty, because no Man will put into it a&nbsp;Hundred Pounds in Money, when he can purchase a Note of the same Value for&nbsp;Ninety Nine; and the Consequence will be this, that&nbsp;the Lender, or rather the Jobber, will never&nbsp;rest till he is repaid, that so he may be making advantage by a New Purchase; And if&nbsp;this will be the effect of a Credit worse only&nbsp;by one </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> than Money, what will it&nbsp;be when ’tis sunk to Sixteen; Whereas, on&nbsp;the other side, when a Credit is better than&nbsp;Money, the Coffers will ever be full, because&nbsp;all Men will endeavour to put in their Money, and be impatient till ’tis done; And thus&nbsp;it will be, when the Lender thinks himself&nbsp;secure, and makes more Profit by having his&nbsp;Money in the Bank then in his Chest, who&nbsp;will therefore receive out no more at a time,&nbsp;then his necessities shall require, and for the&nbsp;same Reason, those to whom he pays it, will&nbsp;endeavour to return it thither again so soon&nbsp;as they can. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">IV. As to the Fourth thing Proposed, The necessity the Nation lies under to have&nbsp;its Credit setled this present Sessions, it will&nbsp;appear, if we consider, how <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6"> now&nbsp;stands in Competition with all </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> besides, as to the Specie of Money, and how&nbsp;it will stand before another Sessions; ’Tis&nbsp;generally agreed, that about One Moiety of&nbsp;the Money of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> is already Center’d in&nbsp;that great City, and the rest is not enough to&nbsp;pay the Debts owing to it, together with&nbsp;his Majesties Revenues, Bonds already entered into, and Taxes now to be given, for&nbsp;Six Months longer, besides the Foreign Bills,&nbsp;which are generally made payable there, all&nbsp;which must be returned in Specie; for though&nbsp;by an Act of this present Sessions: Intituled,&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">An Act for the farther Remedying the ill State&nbsp;of the Coin of this Kingdom</span><span class="font6">, it is among other&nbsp;things Provided, That all Money that shall&nbsp;be brought in upon Account of Taxes, or&nbsp;Revenues, or Loans, at Five Shillings and&nbsp;Eight Pence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per</span><span class="font6"> Ounce, shall be carryed to&nbsp;the next adjacent Mint, in order to be&nbsp;Recoined, yet this will no way be Serviceable to&nbsp;the Country, unless a Credit be setled, it&nbsp;must otherwise be sent up to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6"> after&nbsp;Coined, for want of Returns, the Debts due to&nbsp;the Country being paid there in Bank, which&nbsp;is Sixteen </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> worse than Money, and&nbsp;those due from the Country demanded in&nbsp;Specie, so that the Money of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> is every&nbsp;Week brought up thither; and then, if it be&nbsp;next considered, what Methods are left to&nbsp;the Country, to draw it back again, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> by&nbsp;Provisions and some few other things, ’twill&nbsp;be reasonable to believe, that seeing the supply made from that City to the Country is&nbsp;greater than what is made from the Country&nbsp;thither, all the Cash of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> will Center&nbsp;there in a short time, to the Ruining of the&nbsp;other Trading Cities, and disabling of the&nbsp;Country to pay future Taxes; and this will&nbsp;make the dependence on </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London</span><span class="font6"> still greater,&nbsp;till by its own Bloatiness it must at last burst,&nbsp;when the Estates of the Traders shall consist&nbsp;only in Debts due from the Country, which&nbsp;must still lye out, for want of a Specie to pay&nbsp;them in; so that all the Advantage </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">London&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">will receive is, that it will be last Ruined. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Now if a good Credit be settled out of Hand, and the Mints continued in the&nbsp;Country, the Money that is now there may&nbsp;be still kept there, and Methods found out to&nbsp;increase it, and the Trade of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> carryed&nbsp;on with an equal Circulation in all places;&nbsp;this will keep up the Rents of the Lands of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">, which must otherwise fall in their&nbsp;Values, suitable to the distance they stand in&nbsp;from that great Metropolis. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">If it be Objected, That the Management of this Credit will be very costly to the Nation; I humbly conceive, that the Profits&nbsp;thereof will not only support its Charge, but&nbsp;also bring in a great Overplus, which may&nbsp;be usefully Imployed to the Nations Advantage; yet were this Objection true, nothing can be termed good Husbandry which&nbsp;spoils our Trade, the stopping whereof but&nbsp;for one Month, will be many Millions lost to&nbsp;the Kingdom. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">If by Rectifying this, or any better Proposal from a more thinking Head, the Credit of the Nation may be setled in this present&nbsp;Sessions, I have Reaped the End I Aimed at,&nbsp;the Good and Welfare of my Native Country;&nbsp;which I Humbly submit to your Honours great&nbsp;Wisdom, and shall be Ready to Explain any&nbsp;thing that may seem doubtful, when I am&nbsp;thereto Commanded. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 100pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Your Honours </span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 100pt;"><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Most Obedient Servant, </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:left;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 100pt;">JOHN CARY. </p>

<p class="font0" style="text-align:center">SOME</p>
<p class="font4" style="text-align:center">CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p class="font0" style="text-align:center">Relating to the carrying on</p>
<p class="font3" style="text-align:center">The Linnen Manufacture</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the KINGDOM of</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="font8">IRELAND. </span></p>
<p class="font0" style="text-align:center;padding:0pt 0pt 40pt 0pt;">First Published in the Year, MDCCIV. </p>

<p class="font5" style="text-align:center">SOME</p>
<h6 style="text-align:center"><span class="font10">CONSIDERATIONS</span></h6>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:center">Relating to</p>
<h6 style="text-align:center"><span class="font10">The Linnen Manufacture</span></h6>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:center">In the Kingdom of</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">IRELAND. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">THE Linnen Manufacture in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, being a Subject so much&nbsp;discours’d of the last Sessions&nbsp;of Parliament, I humbly presume to offer some Thoughts&nbsp;how it may best be carried on. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But before I enter upon it, I will Consider the State of that Kingdom, with respect to its Foreign Trade; the Ballance whereof I take to be against them, and must&nbsp;therefore be Supplied, by carrying out their&nbsp;Coin, which is already grown so Scarce, that&nbsp;’tis to be fear’d, in a short time there will be&nbsp;little left. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">To explain this, I will lay down some of those steps, by which the Ballance of Trade, daily Alters to their Prejudice. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Ist, The great fall of their Products, <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> Wool, Tallow, Hides, Beef, &amp;c. which&nbsp;are abated in their Prices above one Third&nbsp;of what they yielded before the War; so that&nbsp;should the same Quantities of those Commodities be bought up for Exportation, as&nbsp;formerly there were, yet they would not&nbsp;amount to the Value they then did. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">IIly, The Ports of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Spain</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France</span><span class="font6">, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Flanders</span><span class="font6">, which were their Great Markets,&nbsp;being now shut against them, the Profits&nbsp;which they made by their Foreign Trade in&nbsp;the times of Peace, over and above the first&nbsp;value of the Commodities exported, are also&nbsp;lost to the Kingdom. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">IIIly, The Prohibiting the Exportation of their Woollen Manufactures, whereby&nbsp;their People were Employed, and their Labours sold to Foreign Nations, hath very&nbsp;much lessened the Ballance of their Foreign&nbsp;Trade. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">IVly, The great Sums of Money spent in this Kingdom by the Nobility and Gentry&nbsp;of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, who come over hither for Pleasure,&nbsp;or Necessary Attendances, on the Court, Parliament, or Private Affairs, and send hither&nbsp;their Children for Education; the Purchases&nbsp;they have lately made of the Forfeited&nbsp;Estates; and the yearly Remittances thence for&nbsp;the Rents of Lands belonging to the Nobility&nbsp;and Gentry of this Kingdom, do all make&nbsp;against them. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Vly, The great Consumption of Commodities among them from this Kingdom, which, though it Encreases our Trade, and&nbsp;makes it our Interest to Support that Kingdom, must be allowed to be a Prejudice to&nbsp;them. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">All which being laid together, it seems apparent to me, that the Ballance of their&nbsp;Trade must every Year grow more against&nbsp;them, till their Mony is drawn away, except some New Manufacture, fit for Exportation, be Encouraged amongst them. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And I think none more proper than that of Linnen; which, besides the Employment&nbsp;it will give to their Poor, will also take up&nbsp;large Tracts of Land for Raising of Hemp&nbsp;and Flax; and being a Manufacture no way&nbsp;Interfering with our own, we may take it&nbsp;from them, in Barter for what they have&nbsp;hence, without any Manner of Prejudice to&nbsp;the Trade of this Kingdom. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Besides, The People of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, being Employed on the Linnen Manufacture, would&nbsp;by degrees be taken off from making so much&nbsp;Worsted and Woollen Yarn as they now&nbsp;do, which they send hither at Cheaper Rates&nbsp;than we are able to make ’em; The Price&nbsp;of Labour in all Places being according&nbsp;to the Prices of Privisions, and those according to the Rents of Lands, the Poor can afford to work there on lower Terms than it&nbsp;can be expected they shou’d do here; On&nbsp;the other side, if the low Labour of the&nbsp;Poor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, was Employ’d on Spinning&nbsp;of Linnen Yarn, it would be an Advantage&nbsp;to the Kingdom of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">, to have it sent&nbsp;hither, because it would Enable us to make&nbsp;our Fustions, and other Manufactures, where&nbsp;it is used, Cheaper than now we do; whilst&nbsp;our own Poor might be Employed on Spinning of Wool; and we might Afford to give&nbsp;them better Wages, without fear of being&nbsp;Beat out of our Manufactures by any other&nbsp;Nation, provided Care was taken to keep our&nbsp;Wool at Home. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The next thing to be Considered is, how this Work may be best carried on; which I&nbsp;am of Opinion, must be done by a Corporation, with a Joint-Stock, Sufficient, not only&nbsp;to Buy up what Linnens shall be made, but&nbsp;also to Furnish the Kingdom with Money on&nbsp;Easy Terms; which will likewise Encourage&nbsp;the Raising of Hemp and Flax. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">If the High Rates of Interest in <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland </span><span class="font6">be considered, and the present State of the&nbsp;Linnen Manufacture there, ’twill not be&nbsp;Difficult to see, how Unlikely it is to be carried on by Private Stocks, who can make&nbsp;Ten </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent. per Annum</span><span class="font6">, by letting out&nbsp;their Money; ’tis true, the late Act hath reduced it to Eight, but that Act, having no&nbsp;regard to Incumbrances entred into before the&nbsp;25th of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">March</span><span class="font6">, 1704, I do not see, how it&nbsp;will much help the People of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> at this&nbsp;time, when the Scarcity of Money does Disable them to Discharge Prior Engagements;&nbsp;so that private Men have Opportunities&nbsp;enough to settle theirs at Ten </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">per Cent.</span><span class="font6"> which&nbsp;in all probability they will rather Chuse, than&nbsp;to lay it out in Linnens, unless they can be&nbsp;Assured of a far greater Profit, than they can&nbsp;make by letting it out. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Besides, as Interest is now managed, ’tis both a Clog to the Gentlemen’s Estates,&nbsp;and a Discouragement to Traders and Manufacturers, considering, that the whole Sum&nbsp;borrowed must be paid in at once; by which&nbsp;means, being got into the Usurer’s Books, they can scarce ever find the way out; Now&nbsp;if the Borrower had Liberty to pay in the&nbsp;Principle, by such Parts as he is able to raise&nbsp;it, and the Interest for so much to Cease from&nbsp;that time, this would Encourage Industry,&nbsp;and Promote Improvements, both in Product and Manufactures, which are the two&nbsp;things that encrease the Wealth of a Nation. </p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">An Infant-Manufacture must be Carried on at a Small Profit, and must as I may say,&nbsp;Fight its way through; which cannot be&nbsp;done, where Interest carries such a Load&nbsp;with it; and therefore I am of Opinion, that Nothing less than a Joynt Stock,&nbsp;can make <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> Flourish; which will in&nbsp;the Consequence turn likewise to the Advantage of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">; the Gentlemen of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">being by these Means made more Easy in&nbsp;their Circumstances, and having their Former&nbsp;Incumbrances brought Lower, will Spend&nbsp;more of their Money here, and Wear more of&nbsp;our Manufactures there. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">Nor <span class="font6">will this way of Lending out Money be any Disadvantage to a Corporation, who will find fit Opportunities of Employing their Stock, as fast as it is paid in; and&nbsp;the Profits thereof being Returned hither in&nbsp;Linnens, they may Afford to sell them Cheaper, than Private Stocks can do. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">But I do not think this Work can be presently Brought about; ’twill not be Easy&nbsp;to Perswade the Landlords nor Tenants of&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, to leave off the way of Husbandry&nbsp;they are now upon, and to Turn their Lands&nbsp;to Hemp and Flax, till they see some Encouragement; But when they shall find this&nbsp;New Product bring Ready Money, they will&nbsp;soon Set upon it; if the Manufacturer receives Ready Money for his Cloath, he will be able&nbsp;to pay Ready Money both for Materials and&nbsp;Labour, which Circulation will Encourage&nbsp;both the Farmer and the Manufacturer; and&nbsp;by Degrees, Hemp and Flax-seed will be&nbsp;Sowed in all Lands Proper for them, and the&nbsp;Owners will soon see the Difference, between Raising Commodities, for which there&nbsp;is a Present Demand, and such, as lye on&nbsp;their Hands; For though </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> may in&nbsp;time Produce greater Quantities of Hemp&nbsp;and Flax than they can Work up, yet not&nbsp;more than </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6"> may Take off, without&nbsp;Prejudice to any Foreign Trade we drive;&nbsp;and their Number of Hands, will in all probability be Encreased by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">French</span><span class="font6"> Refugees,&nbsp;who will be Glad to go thither, where they&nbsp;may be Employed in a Manufacture, so natural to them as Linnen is; which will also&nbsp;give a Fatal Blow to the Kingdom of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">France&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">in that Manufacture. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The People in the North of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"></span> <span class="font6">make good Cloath, sell it at Reasonable Rates,&nbsp;and wou’d every Year make much more,&nbsp;had they a Vent for it; And it is to be observed, that Money is not Plentier, nor Rents&nbsp;paid better, in any part of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, than&nbsp;there. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Rents of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> grow due at two Times of Payment, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font6"> 1st of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">May</span><span class="font6">, and&nbsp;1st of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">November</span><span class="font6">; the first becomes payable&nbsp;whilst their Cattle are Lean, which puts the&nbsp;Tenants under great Straits, and forces them&nbsp;to sell very low, if they are prest for Money;&nbsp;but the Second Payment is more easily made,&nbsp;their Fat Cattle being sold, and their Harvest&nbsp;over; This is the State of that part of the&nbsp;Kingdom that depends on Feeding and Tillage; but where the Linnen Manufacture is,&nbsp;the Tenants are much easier; they Spin in&nbsp;the Winter Nights, and at other leisure times,&nbsp;which being wove into Cloath, and whiten’d&nbsp;early in the Year, provides Money for their&nbsp;first Payment, without selling their Cattle before fatted for a Market. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">It is necessary for a New Undertaking, to be attended with some lucky Accident; the&nbsp;Linnen Manufacture can never be begun in&nbsp;<span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> at a more seasonable time than now,&nbsp;being Imported hither Custom Free, when all&nbsp;the other Linnens of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font6"> pay considerable&nbsp;Duties. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">The Gentlemen of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6"> at this time seem to be Discontented, they find themselves&nbsp;Uneasy, but cannot tell where the Sore lies;&nbsp;therefore, sometimes they Complain of one&nbsp;thing, and sometimes of another; but the&nbsp;true Ground of all is this; Their Exports&nbsp;are lessened, whilst their Imports encrease&nbsp;upon them, and the Specie of their Money&nbsp;decreases every Day; by which means their&nbsp;Rents come in slowly, their Products fall&nbsp;on their Hands, and will more, as they encrease above their Expence; so that their&nbsp;Improvements rather turn to their Disadvantage; and their Lands must fall (which ’tis&nbsp;our Interest to keep up) unless some new&nbsp;Product be encouraged, which may be Manufactured amongst them; If this was done,&nbsp;They would soon see where their Interest&nbsp;lay; and tho’ I do not believe they would&nbsp;all fall on sowing Hemp and Flax, nor is&nbsp;it necessary they should, yet there would be&nbsp;so much Land turn’d that way, as might&nbsp;restrain their other Products, within the&nbsp;compass of their Exports, and Home&nbsp;Consumption, and cause a Circulation of Money through all parts of the Kingdom. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">This will give a greater Employment to the Poor of <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland</span><span class="font6">, and Encourage People&nbsp;to settle among them, without any manner&nbsp;of Prejudice to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">England</span><span class="font6">; and Create a mutual Friendship, and a profitable&nbsp;Correspondence, between both Kingdoms. </span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:12pt;">And<span class="font5"> </span><span class="font6">as the Establishing such a Fund will be an Advantage to that Kingdom, so it&nbsp;will bring a considerable Profit to the&nbsp;Undertakers, besides the Benefit which may&nbsp;arise from it to the Government, during the&nbsp;Continuance of this War. </span></p>
